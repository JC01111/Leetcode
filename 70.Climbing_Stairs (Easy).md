## 70. Climbing Stairs (Easy)

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150

<br>

### Question:
You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

<br>

**Example 1:**
> Input: n = 2
> 
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
> 1. 1 step + 1 step
> 2. 2 steps

**Example 2:**
> Input: n = 3
> 
> Output: 3
> 
>Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
> 1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
> 2. 1 step + 2 steps
> 3. 2 steps + 1 step

<br>

**Constraints:**
`1 <= n <= 45`

<br>

### KeyPoints: 
This question is fibonacci sequence, each n takes the sum of previous stairs dP[n-1] and dP[n-2].  
- n = 1, 1 way  
- n = 2, 2 ways
- n = 3, 3 ways = 2 + 1
- n = 4, 5 ways: if choose 1, we have n=3 stairs left -> 3 ways; if choose 2, we have n=2 stairs left, which is 2 ways, so we take the sum of these two methods, which is 2 + 3 = 5 ways.
- n = 5, 8 ways: if choose size of 1, we have n=4 stairs left -> 5 ways; if choose size of 2, we have n=3 stairs left -> 3 ways, so we have 8 ways in total.

### My Solution:
```
class Solution(object):
    def climbStairs(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        dP = [0] * (n+1)
        dP[1] = 1
        if n > 1:
            dP[2] = 2

        for i in range(3, n+1):
            dP[i] = dP[i-1] + dP[i-2]
        return dP[n]
```

### My Alternative Solution:
```
class Solution(object):
    def climbStairs(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        dP = [0, 1, 2]
        temp = 0
        if n < 3:
            return dP[n]
        else:
            for i in range(3, n+1):
                temp = dP[i-1] + dP[i-2]
                dP.append(temp)
        return dP[n]
```
