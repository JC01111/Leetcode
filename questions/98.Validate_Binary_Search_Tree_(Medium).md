### Question:
Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**Example 1:**

<img src="images/98_1.jpg" alt="drawing" width="300"/>

> **Input:** root = [2, 1, 3]
> 
> **Output:** true

**Example 2:**

<img src="images/98_2.jpg" alt="drawing" width="430"/>

> **Input:** root = [5, 1, 4, null, null, 3, 6]
> 
> **Output:** false
>
> **Explanation:** The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.

**Edge case:**
> **Input:** [2, 2, 2]
> 
> **Output:** false
>
> **Explanation:** The left subtree's value and the right subtree's value should be less than and greater than the root's value.

### Wrong answer:
Look at the edge case above [2 ,2 ,2], in that case, this is not a valid BST because the left subtree val and right subtree val should be either less than or greater than the node's val. So I should add an extra checking condition that `prev.val >= node.val`.
```python
if prev:
    if prev.val > node.val:
        res = False
        return False
prev = node
dfs(node.right)
```

### My Solution:
Again, just implement the **dfs** and add a global variable `prev` to keep track of the previous node. Look at example 2, we first dive into `5`'s left subtree `1`, now the `prev=1` and we return to `5`, now we dive into `5`'s right subtree `4`, after we visit `4` we dive into `3` and now `5 >= 3` for `prev.val >= node.val`, which violates the checking condition so we break the for-loop and return False.

```python
class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        # DFS and compare node with its left and right
        prev, res = None, None
        def dfs(node):
            if node is None:
                return
            dfs(node.left)
            nonlocal prev, res
            if prev:
                if prev.val >= node.val:
                    res = False
                    return False
            prev = node
            dfs(node.right)
        dfs(root)
        if res is False:
            return False
        else:
            return True
```
<br>

### Alternative Solution:
This is also similar to **non-recursive dfs** implementation. First, iteratively add all the **left subtree** into stack, then we `pop` the latest added node and save it as `prev` and go to its `right`.
```python
class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        prev = None
        stack = []
        while stack or root:
            while root:
                stack.append(root)
                root = root.left
            root = stack.pop()
            if prev and prev.val >= root.val:
                    return False
            prev = root
            root = root.right
        return True
```
