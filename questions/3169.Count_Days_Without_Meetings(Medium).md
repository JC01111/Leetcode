<br>

### Question:
You are given a positive integer `days` representing the total number of days an employee is available for work (starting from day 1). You are also given a 2D array `meetings` of size `n` where, `meetings[i] = [start_i, end_i]` represents the starting and ending days of meeting `i` (inclusive).

Return the count of days when the employee is available for work but no meetings are scheduled.

**Note**: The meetings may overlap.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** days = 10, meetings = [[5,7],[1,3],[9,10]] <br>
> **Output:** 2 <br>
> **Explanation:** There is no meeting scheduled on the 4th and 8th days.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** days = 5, meetings = [[2,4],[1,3]] <br>
> **Output:** 1 <br>
> **Explanation:** There is no meeting scheduled on the 5th day.

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** days = 6, meetings = [[1,6]] <br>
> **Output:** 0 <br>
> **Explanation:** Meetings are scheduled for all working days.

**Edge Case:**
> **Input:** days = 8, meetings = [[3,4],[4,8],[2,5],[3,8]] <br>
> **Output:** 1 <br>
> **Explanation:** There is no meeting scheduled on the 1st day.

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= days <= 10^9`

* `1 <= meetings.length <= 10^5`

* `meetings[i].length == 2`

* `1 <= meetings[i][0] <= meetings[i][1] <= days`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
1. Sort intervals.

2. Initialize `prev = 0`, we know there is a day without meeting if `start > prev + 1`, when the current start is greater than the previous day by at least 1 day. It also covers the edge case when `day 1` is available, so `2 > 0 + 1` will be valid.

3. Finally, don't forget to compare the last interval's `end` with `prev`, because it is possible that `days = 10` and we have day `10` available. We just update `ans += days - prev`.

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def countDays(self, days: int, meetings: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Sort, count # days between prev and next_meeting start
        # In the end, ans += days - prev

        # TC: O(nlogn), n=len(meetings), SC: O(1)
        meetings.sort()
        ans = 0
        prev = 0
        for start, end in meetings:
            if start > prev + 1:
                ans += start - prev - 1
            # Prevent the smaller end in new meeting
            prev = max(prev, end)
        # Compare with the last day
        ans += days - prev
        return ans
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(nlog(n))$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
