### Question:
There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `ith` station is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `ith` station to its next `(i + 1)th` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return _the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return_ `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is **guaranteed** to be **unique**

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
> 
> **Output:** 3
>
> **Explanation:** <br>
> Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4 <br>
> Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8 <br>
> Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7 <br>
> Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6 <br>
> Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5 <br>
> Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3. <br>
> Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
> 
> **Output:** -1
>
> **Explanation:** <br>
> You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station. <br>
> Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4 <br>
> Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3 <br>
> Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3 <br>
> You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3. <br>
> Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

#### Constraints:
* `n == gas.length == cost.length`

* `1 <= n <= 10^5`

* `0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 10^4`

### Walk-through: 
This is the Kadane's algorithm, we maintain `total` to be `0` if the difference of `gas[i] - cost[i] < 0`, and we also forward the `res`, which is the next index of station.

1. The base case is that if `sum(gas) < sum(cost)` we know there is no way to run a cycle. In **Example 2**, `sum(gas) = 9`, `sum(cost) = 10`, `sum(gas) - sum(cost) = -1`, which is not possible to run a cycle. But in **Example 1**, `sum(gas) - sum(cost) = 15 - 15 = 0`, which can run a cycle if `sum(gas) - sum(cost) >= 0`.

2. We will set `res = i + 1` if the next index will not lead `total < 0` then we just from this index. If this index will not work, we will reset `res = i + 1`, where `i` is index after the preivous one. This works because if there exists a solution, even a very small positive `gas[i] - cost[i]` can contribute to cycle. Even if this index doesn't work, it will reset to the next positive `gas[i] - cost[i]` index `i`.

For example, we have gas = [2,3,0] and cost = [0,0,5]. If we take just solely value 3 without 2, it wouldn't be enough to pass the last station, but previous values definitely bring some value to the outcome.

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        if sum(gas) < sum(cost):
            return -1
        res, total = 0, 0
        for i in range(len(gas)):
            total += gas[i] - cost[i]
            if total < 0:
                total = 0
                res = i + 1
        return res
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
