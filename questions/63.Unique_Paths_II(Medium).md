<br>

### Question:
You are given an `m x n` integer array `grid`. There is a robot initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as `1` or `0` respectively in `grid`. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.

Return _the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner_.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 10^9`.

<br>

**Example 1:**

<img src="../images/63_1.jpg" width=200>

> **Input:** obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
> 
> **Output:** 2
>
> **Explanation:** There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above. <br>
> There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner: <br>
> 1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down <br>
> 2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right

**Example 2:**

<img src="../images/63_2.jpg" width=150>

> **Input:** obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
> 
> **Output:** 1

**Edge Case:**
> **Input:** obstacleGrid = [[1,0]]
> 
> **Output:** 0

**Edge Case:**
> **Input:** obstacleGrid = [[1],[0]]
> 
> **Output:** 0

**Edge Case:**
> **Input:**  obstacleGrid = [[0,1,0,0]]
> 
> **Output:** 0

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `m == obstacleGrid.length`

* `n == obstacleGrid[i].length`

* `1 <= m, n <= 100`

* `obstacleGrid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

<br>

### Walk-through: 
1. Base case: check the starting postion if this is `1`, if so, that means we have no way to reach the end, so we should return `0`. Otherwise, set starting position to `1`.

2. Fill out the base case for the first row and the first column. We check if current grid is `1`, if so, we should set this grid to be `0`. Else, we should set current grid to either its previous row or previous col.

3. Fill out the rest by this recurrence relation `dp[r][c] = dp[r-1][c] + dp[r][c-1]`. We also need to check if current `obstacleGrid[r][c] == 1` or not, if so, we should set it to be `0`.

4. Finally, return the last grid of `obstacleGrid`.

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # dp: how many ways to reach, dp[r][c] = dp[r-1][c] + dp[r][c-1], if grid is obstacle, set to 0
        # Check starting pos is 1 or not, if so, return 0. Otherwise, set it to be 1

        # TC: O(m*n), m=rows, n=cols, SC: O(1)
        rows, cols = len(obstacleGrid), len(obstacleGrid[0])
        # Base case
        if obstacleGrid[0][0] == 1:
            return 0
        obstacleGrid[0][0] = 1
        for c in range(1, cols):
            # If current pos is obstacle, set to 0
            if obstacleGrid[0][c] == 1:
                obstacleGrid[0][c] = 0
            # Otherwise, take its previous col
            else:
                obstacleGrid[0][c] = obstacleGrid[0][c-1]
        for r in range(1, rows):
            if obstacleGrid[r][0] == 1:
                obstacleGrid[r][0] = 0
            else:
                obstacleGrid[r][0] = obstacleGrid[r-1][0]

        # Fill out the rest
        for r in range(1, rows):
            for c in range(1, cols):
                # If is obstacle, set to 0
                if obstacleGrid[r][c] == 1:
                    obstacleGrid[r][c] = 0
                # Else sets to the sum of left, up neighbors
                else:
                    obstacleGrid[r][c] = obstacleGrid[r-1][c] + obstacleGrid[r][c-1]
            
        return obstacleGrid[-1][-1]
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(m*n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
