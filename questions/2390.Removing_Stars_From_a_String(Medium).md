<br>

### Question:
You are given a string `s`, which contains stars`*.

In one operation, you can:

* Choose a star in `s`.

* Remove the closest **non-star** character to its **left**, as well as remove the star itself.

Return the string after **all** stars have been removed.

**Note:**

* The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible.

* It can be shown that the resulting string will always be unique.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** s = "leet**cod*e"
> 
> **Output:** "lecoe"
>
> **Explanation:** Performing the removals from left to right:
> \- The closest character to the 1st star is 't' in "leet**cod*e". s becomes "lee*cod*e".
> \- The closest character to the 2nd star is 'e' in "lee*cod*e". s becomes "lecod*e".
> \- The closest character to the 3rd star is 'd' in "lecod*e". s becomes "lecoe".
> There are no more stars, so we return "lecoe".

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** s = "erase*****"
> 
> **Output:** ""
>
> **Explanation:** The entire string is removed, so we return an empty string.

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`

* `s` consists of lowercase English letters and stars `*`.

* The operation above can be performed on `s`.

<br>

### Walk-through: 
Use stack to store every **non-star** character into `stack[]`, when we have "*", we pop the last element from `stack[]` to remove the star's left **non-star** character.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def removeStars(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Use stack to append all char from s
        # If i == "*", pop the top element from stack to remove its left

        # TC: O(n), SC: O(n)
        stack = []
        for i in s:
            if i == "*":
                stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append(i)
        
        return "".join(stack)
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$
