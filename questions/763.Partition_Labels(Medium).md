### Question:
You are given a string `s`. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part.

Note that the partition is done so that after concatenating all the parts in order, the resultant string should be `s`.

Return _a list of integers representing the size of these parts_.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
> 
> **Output:** [9,7,8]
>
> **Explanation:** <br>
> The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij". <br>
> This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
> A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** s = "eccbbbbdec"
> 
> **Output:** [10]

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= s.length <= 500`

* `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

<br>

### Walk-through: 
1. Hashmap to store each element's last index

2. Start from the beginning, keep track of the `size` of parition and the `end` of current group

3. If index i reaches `end` we can append `size` to `res` and reset `size`

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def partitionLabels(self, s: str) -> List[int]:
        # 1. Iterate s and save each char's last index in hashmap
        # 2. Loop over s again and update maxIndex variable when we process each char in s, if maxIndex == i, means every chars before i will not be have index greater than i. So we can save the partition and update start and add this length to ans[]

        # TC: O(n), n=len(s), SC: O(26)
        start, end = 0, 0
        hashmap = {}     # {char: last_index}
        ans = []
        # Record the last index of each char in s
        for i in range(len(s)):
            hashmap[s[i]] = i
        # Compare and count the partition
        for i in range(len(s)):
            # Update to the char's last index if greater than current end
            end = max(end, hashmap[s[i]])
            # Save this parition length into hashmap
            if end == i:
                ans.append(end - start + 1)
                start = i + 1
        return ans
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, `n` is the length of `s`, loop over the whole `s` string twice. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because we only store `26` keys in the hashmap at most, which is constant complexity.
