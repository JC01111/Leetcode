<br>

### Question:
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `fee` representing a transaction fee.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

**Note:**

* You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

* The transaction fee is only charged once for each stock purchase and sale.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2
> 
> **Output:** 8
>
> **Explanation:** The maximum profit can be achieved by: <br>
> \- Buying at prices[0] = 1 <br>
> \- Selling at prices[3] = 8 <br>
> \- Buying at prices[4] = 4 <br>
> \- Selling at prices[5] = 9 <br>
> The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3
> 
> **Output:** 6

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= prices.length <= 5 * 10^4`

* `1 <= prices[i] < 5 * 10^4`

* `0 <= fee < 5 * 10^4`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
The Naive 1D DP and 2D DP methods are exactly the same as the previous questions. 

The optimized way to solve it is to use `buy, sell` to save two states, and to update the `buy` state, we find the max of its original `buy` and `sell - price`, which is to take the profits from `sell` to buy. 

Similarly, we update `sell` by taking the max of `sell`, and `buy + price - fee`, which is used to find the profit of last buy profit plus if we sell at this price minus the fee.

### Naive 1D DP Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:
        dp = {}
        def dfs(i, has_stock):
            if i >= len(prices):
                return 0
            if (i, has_stock) in dp:
                return dp[(i, has_stock)]
            if has_stock:
                sell = dfs(i+1, False) + (prices[i] - fee)
                not_sell = dfs(i+1, True)
                dp[(i, has_stock)] = max(sell, not_sell)
            else:
                buy = dfs(i+1, True) - prices[i]
                not_buy = dfs(i+1, False)
                dp[(i, has_stock)] = max(buy, not_buy)
            return dp[(i, has_stock)]

        return dfs(0, False)
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$

### Optimized Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:
        buy, sell = float("-inf"), 0
        for price in prices:
            buy = max(buy, sell - price)
            sell = max(sell, buy + price - fee)
        return sell
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
