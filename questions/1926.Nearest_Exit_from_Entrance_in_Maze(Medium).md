<br>

### Question:
You are given an `m x n` matrix maze (**0-indexed**) with empty cells (represented as `'.'`) and walls (represented as `'+'`). You are also given the `entrance` of the maze, where `entrance = [entrance_row, entrance_col]` denotes the row and column of the cell you are initially standing at.

In one step, you can move one cell **up, down, left,** or **right**. You cannot step into a cell with a wall, and you cannot step outside the maze. Your goal is to find the **nearest exit** from the `entrance`. An **exit** is defined as an **empty cell** that is at the **border** of the `maze`. The `entrance` **does not count** as an exit.

Return _the **number of steps** in the shortest path from the_ `entrance` _to the nearest exit, or_ `-1` _if no such path exists_.

**Example 1:**

<img src="../images/1926_1.jpg" width=300>

> **Input:** maze = [["+","+",".","+"],[".",".",".","+"],["+","+","+","."]], entrance = [1,2]
> 
> **Output:** 1
>
> **Explanation:** There are 3 exits in this maze at [1,0], [0,2], and [2,3]. <br>
> Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,2]. <br>
> \- You can reach [1,0] by moving 2 steps left. <br>
> \- You can reach [0,2] by moving 1 step up. <br>
> It is impossible to reach [2,3] from the entrance. <br>
> Thus, the nearest exit is [0,2], which is 1 step away.

**Example 2:**

<img src="../images/1926_2.jpg" width=220>

> **Input:** maze = [["+","+","+"],[".",".","."],["+","+","+"]], entrance = [1,0]
> 
> **Output:** 2
>
> **Explanation:** There is 1 exit in this maze at [1,2]. <br>
> [1,0] does not count as an exit since it is the entrance cell. <br>
> Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,0]. <br>
> \- You can reach [1,2] by moving 2 steps right. <br>
> Thus, the nearest exit is [1,2], which is 2 steps away.

**Example 3:**

<img src="../images/1926_3.jpg" width=180>

> **Input:** maze = [[".","+"]], entrance = [0,0]
> 
> **Output:** -1
>
> **Explanation:** There are no exits in this maze.

#### Constraints:
* `maze.length == m`

* `maze[i].length == n`

* `1 <= m, n <= 100`

* `maze[i][j]` is either `'.'` or `'+'`.

* `entrance.length == 2`

* `0 <= entrancerow < m`

* `0 <= entrancecol < n`

* `entrance` will always be an empty cell.

### Walk-through: 
Run **BFS** from `entrance` to find the shortest path, and we append new pair `[[r, c], moves + 1]` into `deque[]`. For each grid, we search its four directions neighbors. We know there is an exit if `row == 0 or row == (rows - 1)`, `col == 0 or col == (cols - 1)`. Lastly, we return `-1` if there is no valid path.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def nearestExit(self, maze: List[List[str]], entrance: List[int]) -> int:
        # Run BFS to find the minimum path to find exit
        rows, cols = len(maze), len(maze[0])
        moves = 0
        deque, visited = collections.deque([(entrance, moves)]), set()
        visited.add((entrance[0], entrance[1]))

        directions = [[-1, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]]
        while deque:
            pos, moves = deque.popleft()
            row, col = pos
            # Return moves if we find exit
            if (row == 0 or row == (rows-1) or col == 0 or col == (cols-1)) and [row, col] != entrance:
                return moves
            # Search all directions
            for dr, dc in directions:
                r, c = row + dr, col + dc
                if r in range(rows) and c in range(cols) and (r, c) not in visited and maze[r][c] != '+':
                    deque.append(([r, c], moves + 1))
                    visited.add((r, c))
        return -1
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(m * n)$, `m * n` is the dimension of `maze`.  <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(m * n)$

### Python Solution without visited set:
This method we don't use `visited()` set, but we set the grid we visited to be `"+"`, so when the next grid pop from `deque` will not go back to this visited grid.
```python
class Solution:
    def nearestExit(self, maze: List[List[str]], entrance: List[int]) -> int:
        rows, cols = len(maze), len(maze[0])
        deque = collections.deque([(entrance, 0)])
        maze[entrance[0]][entrance[1]] = '+'

        directions = [[-1, 0], [1, 0], [0, -1], [0, 1]]
        while deque:
            pos, steps = deque.popleft()
            row, col = pos
            if (row == 0 or row == (rows-1) or col == 0 or col == (cols-1)) and [row, col] != entrance:
                    return steps
            for dr, dc in directions:
                r, c = row + dr, col + dc
                if r in range(rows) and c in range(cols) and maze[r][c] != '+':
                    deque.append(([r, c], steps+1))
                    maze[r][c] = '+'
        return -1
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(m * n)$, `m * n` is the dimension of `maze`.  <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(m * n)$
