### Edge Cases:
**Edge Case:**
> **Input:** eventws = [[1,2],[1,2],[3,3],[1,5],[1,5]] <br>
> **Output:** 5 <br>

<br>

### Walk-through: 
1. For interval type question, it is a good habit to sort first.

2. Find the max_end_day from `events`, so we can loop over day `i` in `[1, max_end_day]`. For each day `i`, we are adding `start_day < i` from `events`, and we `heappush()` event[j]'s `end_day` into `minHeap`, otherwise, the start_day won't help us to keep the correct order in `minHeap` (edge case). 

3. Check minHeap's end_day from the top of minHeap, if `minHeap[0] < i`, we need to remove this event from `minHeap`, because we will not be able to take this event after day `i`. 

4. Lastly, if `minHeap` is not empty, we take this current event in the top of `minHeap` and increment `ans += 1`.

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxEvents(self, events: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # 1. Sort events and find max end day from events
        # 2. Loop over each day i [0, max_day+1], and add days into minHeap if start <= i, also exclude end_day in minHeap < i
        # TC: O(nlog(n) + nlog(k)), n=len(events), k=len(minHeap), SC: O(k)
        
        events = sorted(events)
        j = 0   # event index
        ans = 0
        minHeap = []
        max_day = max(event[1] for event in events)
        # Loop over each day i
        for i in range(1, max_day + 1):
            # Add start_day < i into minHeap
            while j < len(events) and events[j][0] <= i:
                # Only add the end_day into minHeap, otherwise we can't keep the correct order in minHeap
                heapq.heappush(minHeap, events[j][1])
                j += 1
            # Remove previous end_day < i from minHeap
            while minHeap and minHeap[0] < i:
                heapq.heappop(minHeap)
            # Increment ans assume we attend the meeting in the top of minHeap
            if minHeap:
                ans += 1
                heapq.heappop(minHeap)
        return ans
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(nlog(n+k))$, n=len(events), k=len(minHeap), `O(nlog(n))` for sorting `events`, `O(nlog(k))` for heap operation on each day. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(k)$
