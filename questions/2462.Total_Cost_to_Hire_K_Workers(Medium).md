### Question:
You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `costs` where `costs[i]` is the cost of hiring the `ith` worker.

You are also given two integers `k` and `candidates`. We want to hire exactly `k` workers according to the following rules:

* You will run `k` sessions and hire exactly one worker in each session.

* In each hiring session, choose the worker with the lowest cost from either the first `candidates` workers or the last `candidates` workers. Break the tie by the smallest index.

    * For example, if `costs = [3,2,7,7,1,2]` and `candidates = 2`, then in the first hiring session, we will choose the `4th` worker because they have the lowest cost [<u>3,2</u>,7,7,<u>1,2</u>].

    * In the second hiring session, we will choose `1st` worker because they have the same lowest cost as `4th` worker but they have the smallest index [<u>3,2</u>,7,<u>7,2</u>]. Please note that the indexing may be changed in the process.

* If there are fewer than candidates workers remaining, choose the worker with the lowest cost among them. Break the tie by the smallest index.

* A worker can only be chosen once.

Return the total cost to hire exactly `k` workers.

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** costs = [17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8], k = 3, candidates = 4
> 
> **Output:** 11
>
> **Explanation:** We hire 3 workers in total. The total cost is initially 0. <br>
> \- In the first hiring round we choose the worker from [<u>17,12,10,2</u>,7,<u>2,11,20,8</u>]. The lowest cost is 2, and we break the tie by the smallest index, which is 3. The total cost = 0 + 2 = 2. <br>
> \- In the second hiring round we choose the worker from [<u>17,12,10,7,2,11,20,8</u>]. The lowest cost is 2 (index 4). The total cost = 2 + 2 = 4. <br>
> \- In the third hiring round we choose the worker from [<u>17,12,10,7,11,20,8</u>]. The lowest cost is 7 (index 3). The total cost = 4 + 7 = 11. Notice that the worker with index 3 was common in the first and last four workers.
The total hiring cost is 11.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** costs = [1,2,4,1], k = 3, candidates = 3
> 
> **Output:** 4
>
> **Explanation:** We hire 3 workers in total. The total cost is initially 0. <br>
> \- In the first hiring round we choose the worker from [<u>1,2,4,1</u>]. The lowest cost is 1, and we break the tie by the smallest index, which is 0. The total cost = 0 + 1 = 1. Notice that workers with index 1 and 2 are common in the first and last 3 workers. <br>
> \- In the second hiring round we choose the worker from [<u>2,4,1</u>]. The lowest cost is 1 (index 2). The total cost = 1 + 1 = 2. <br>
> \- In the third hiring round there are less than three candidates. We choose the worker from the remaining workers [<u>2,4</u>]. The lowest cost is 2 (index 0). The total cost = 2 + 2 = 4. <br>
The total hiring cost is 4.

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= costs.length <= 10^5`

* `1 <= costs[i] <= 10^5`

* `1 <= k, candidates <= costs.length`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
1. We create two minHeap `left[], right[]` to keep track of the left, right part of `costs`, each minHeap has length `candidates`.

2. We compare the lowest element (top) for these two minHeaps, then `pop()` the smallest element from that minHeap and add new element into that minHeap.

3. Repeat `k` times above.

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def totalCost(self, costs: List[int], k: int, candidates: int) -> int:
        # Maintain two minHeap for left and right by using two pointers i, j
        # Each of them should maintain len(candidates) minHeap
        # Compare the top of two minHeaps and remove the smallest one, and update that minHeap with new element

        # l: [1, 2, 4], r: [2, 4, 1], i = 2, j = 1
        # cost = 1, remove 1 from l
        # l: [2, 4, 1], r: [2, 4, 1], i = 3, j = 1
        # cost = 2, remove 1 from l
        # l: [2, 4], r: [2, 4]
        # cost = 4, remove 2 from l

        # TC: O(n), n = len(costs), SC: O(candidates)
        l_minHeap, r_minHeap = [], []
        l, r = 0, len(costs)-1
        res = 0
        while k > 0:
            # Add elements into l_minHeap
            while len(l_minHeap) < candidates and l <= r:
                heapq.heappush(l_minHeap, costs[l])
                l += 1
            while len(r_minHeap) < candidates and l <= r:
                heapq.heappush(r_minHeap, costs[r])
                r -= 1
            # Compare, add and remove the lower costs
            left = l_minHeap[0] if l_minHeap else float("inf")
            right = r_minHeap[0] if r_minHeap else float("inf")
            if left <= right:
                res += left
                heapq.heappop(l_minHeap)
            else:
                res += right
                heapq.heappop(r_minHeap)
            k -= 1
        
        return res
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, `n` is the length of `costs`. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(\text{candidates})$, we maintain two heaps with length `candidates`.
