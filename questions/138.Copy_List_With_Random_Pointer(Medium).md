### Question:
A linked list of length `n` is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or `null`.

Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly n **brand new** nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. **None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.**

For example, if there are two nodes `X` and `Y` in the original list, where `X.random --> Y`, then for the corresponding two nodes `x` and `y` in the copied list, `x.random --> y`.

Return _the head of the copied linked list_.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:

* `val`: an integer representing `Node.val`

* `random_index`: the index of the node (range from `0` to `n-1`) that the `random` pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

Your code will **only** be given the `head` of the original linked list.

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
> 
> **Output:** [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]

**Example 2:**

<img src="../images/138_2.png" width=700>

> **Input:** head = [[1,1],[2,1]]
> 
> **Output:** [[1,1],[2,1]]

**Example 3:**

<img src="../images/138_3.png" width=700>

> **Input:** head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
> 
> **Output:** [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]

#### Constraints:
* `0 <= n <= 1000`

* `-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4`

* `Node.random` is `null` or is pointing to some node in the linked list.

### Walk-through: 
**Hashmap method:**

We are asked to create a "deep copy" of the list, which is just creating new nodes and set them to be the same as the original nodes in the list. The `next` and `random` are just pointers, we need to assign nodes to these pointers in the copy.

1. We can use a `hashmap{}` to store every nodes through the while loop. 

2. The second while loop we get each node from `hashmap{}`, and link them together by setting `node.next` and `node.random`, both of these attributes can be accessed from `hashmap[head]`.

<br>

**Interweaved method:**
1. We create a new node for each `curr` and add them between `curr` and `curr.next`.

2. We copy `curr.random` to new node `curr.next.random = curr.random.next` (`curr.random.next` points to the copied version of the node that `curr.random` points to.). `curr.random` is the node that `curr` points to by `random` ptr, `curr.random.next` is the copied node of `curr.random`.

3. Finally, we split the old nodes and the new nodes. Simply change the links from `A --> A'` to `A --> B` and `A' --> B` to `A' --> B'`. We use two extra variables `old, new` to keep track of the head of the two lists, just like `dummy = tail`, so we can return `new` in the end.

`Old list:  A --> B --> C --> D`

`Interweaved list:  A --> A' --> B --> B' --> C --> C' --> D --> D'`

### Hashmap Solution:
```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, x: int, next: 'Node' = None, random: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = int(x)
        self.next = next
        self.random = random
"""
class Solution:
    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        # Save every node into hashmap
        # Traverse head to assign copy of .next, .random by accessing the hashmap

        # TC: O(n), n is total nodes, SC: O(n)
        curr = head
        hashmap = {None: None}  # {node: new node}
        # Save each node with copy into hashmap
        while curr:
            hashmap[curr] = Node(curr.val)
            curr = curr.next
        curr = head
        while curr:
            node = hashmap[curr]
            # Assign new node by accessing index(node)
            node.next = hashmap[curr.next]
            node.random = hashmap[curr.random]
            curr = curr.next
        return hashmap[head]
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$

        self.val = int(x)

    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        # Use interweaving method to add new node between curr and curr.next

        while curr:
            node = Node(curr.val, curr.next)
            curr.next = node
            curr = node.next

        curr = head
        while curr:
            if curr.random:
                curr.next.random = curr.random.next
            curr = curr.next.next
        
        # Splitting old nodes: A->A'->B->B'->C->C'->D->D'
        old, new = head, head.next
        first, second = old, new
        while first:
            first.next = first.next.next
            second.next = second.next.next if second.next else None
            first = first.next
            second = second.next
        return new
