### Question:
Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list **sorted** as well.

<br>

**Example 1:**

<img src="../images/82_1.jpg" width=500>

> **Input:** head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
> 
> **Output:** [1,2,5]

**Example 2:**

<img src="../images/82_2.jpg" width=400>

> **Input:** head = [1,1,1,2,3]
> 
> **Output:** [2,3]s

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** head = [1,1,1,2,2]
> 
> **Output:** []

**Example 4:**
> **Input:** head = [1]
> 
> **Output:** [1]

**Example 5:**
> **Input:** head = []
> 
> **Output:** []

<br>

#### Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 300]`.

* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

* The list is guaranteed to be **sorted** in ascending order.

### Walk-through:
We first make sure there is `head and head.next`, so we can start checking the linked-list, otherwise, we just return `dummy.next`, which is `head` (for cases like `head = [], head = [1]`).

We use while loop to skip all the duplicate elements, when the while loop breaks, we need to update `head = head.next` (because we skip duplicate element), also update `prev.next = head` so we can save the new node temporary. We only update this new node to `prev` in the next while loop, we check `if head.val == head.next.val` is False, then we update both node `head = head.next, prev = prev.next`.

If there is no duplicate between `head.val` and `head.next.val`, we update both nodes `head = head.next, prev = prev.next`.

For example, if we have `1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 2`, after we break the while loop at `1 -> 2`, we save `head = head.next = 2, prev.next = head = 2`, and we don't update `prev = prev.next` yet, we run the while loop again, and we found `head.val == head.next.val = 2`, so we continue to update `head = head.next` until `head = None`, and we also update `prev.next = head = None` (we didn't change `prev.next` until there is a case that `head.val != head.next.val`), which replace the previous value of `prev.next = 2`.

### Python Solution:
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Use a prev to save prev node
        # while head.val == head.next.val: head = head.next
        # When the while loop breaks, we need to set head = head.next again, because we don't add duplicate element at all, then set prev.next = head
        # When they are not equal, we update both prev and cur: prev = prev.next, cur=cur.next 

        # 1->1->1->2->2
        # prev = 0, prev.next = None
        # head = None

        # TC: O(n), n is total nodes in head, SC: O(1)
        dummy = ListNode()
        dummy.next = head
        prev = dummy
        while head and head.next:
            if head.val == head.next.val:
                # Update head to skip all duplicate
                while head and head.next and head.val == head.next.val:
                    head = head.next
                head = head.next    # skip the duplicate
                prev.next = head    # temporary save for a new node
            # Update prev only when head.val != head.next.val
            else:
                prev = prev.next
                head = head.next
        return dummy.next
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
