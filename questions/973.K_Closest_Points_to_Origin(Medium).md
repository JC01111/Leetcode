<br>

### Question:
Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [x_i, y_i]` represents a point on the **X-Y** plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

The distance between two points on the **X-Y** plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., `âˆš(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)`.

You may return the answer in **any order**. The answer is **guaranteed** to be **unique** (except for the order that it is in).

<br>

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
> 
> **Output:** [[-2,2]]
>
> **Explanation:** <br>
> The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10). <br>
> The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8). <br>
> Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin. <br>
> We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
> 
> **Output:** [[3,3],[-2,4]]
>
> **Explanation:** The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= k <= points.length <= 10^4`

* `-10^4 <= xi, yi <= 10^4`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
We can use `minHeap` to store `(distance, point)`, and we just pop `k` of them from `minHeap` to `res`.

Slightly optimized method can use `maxHeap` to maintain only `k` elements in `maxHeap` to reach $O(nlog\ k)$ time complexity and $O(k)$ space complexity.

<br>

### Optimized minHeap Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Use minHeap to save [dist, [x, y]], maintan only k closest points
        
        # TC: O(nlog k), n = len(points), SC:O(k)
        minHeap = []
        for x, y in points:
            dist = sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
            heapq.heappush(minHeap, (-dist, [x, y]))
            if len(minHeap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(minHeap)
                
        # Append k closest positions from minHeap
        return [heapq.heappop(minHeap)[1] for _ in range(k)]
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(nlog\ k)$, because we only maintain `k` elements in `maxHeap`. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(k)$

<br>

### minHeap Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Calculate every point's distance to the origin, then use heap to store

        # TC: O(nlog n), n = len(points), SC: O(n)
        minHeap = []
        res = []
        for point in points:
            dist = sqrt((point[0])**2 + (point[1])**2)
            heapq.heappush(minHeap, (dist, point))
        while len(res) < k:
            res.append(heapq.heappop(minHeap)[1])
        return res
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(nlog\ n)$, `n` is the length of `points` Since we maintain `n` elements in `minHeap`, it takes $O(log\ n)$ to insert. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$
