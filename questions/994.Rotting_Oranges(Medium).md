### Question:
You are given an `m x n` `grid` where each cell can have one of three values:

* `0` representing an empty cell,

* `1` representing a fresh orange, or

* `2` representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is **4-directionally adjacent** to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return _the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange_. If _this is impossible, return_ `-1`.

<br>

**Example 1:**

<img src='../images/994.png' width=650>

> **Input:** grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
> 
> **Output:** 4

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
> 
> **Output:** -1
>
> **Explanation:** The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** grid = [[0,2]]
> 
> **Output:** 0
>
> **Explanation:** Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `m == grid.length`

* `n == grid[i].length`

* `1 <= m, n <= 10`

* `grid[i][j]` is `0`, `1`, or `2`.

<br>

### Walk-through: 
1. Loop over the `grid` to store `total` for total oranges we have, `rotten` and `deque` to store the `[r, c]` of the current rotten oranges we know.

2. We run **BFS** on the current rotten oranges we found, and we check their four neighbors, and append the oranges to `deque` if `grid[r][c] == 1` (means we have fresh orange to rot), so we just append the new entry to `deque` and mark this entry as rotten orange.

3. Since we run while loop based on `deque and (total - rotten) > 0`, so if we have rotten all the fresh oranges, we will stop the while loop and we return `moves` or `-1` based on `if rotten == total` or not.

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def orangesRotting(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        total = mins = rotting = 0
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        deque = collections.deque()
        # Loop over grid
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == 2:
                    total += 1
                    rotting += 1
                    deque.append([r, c])
                elif grid[r][c] == 1:
                    total += 1
                    
        # BFS to mark and append neighbor fresh oranges into deque
        directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]
        while deque and (total - rotting) > 0:
            for _ in range(len(deque)):
                row, col = deque.popleft()
                for dr, dc in directions:
                    r, c = dr + row, dc + col
                    if r in range(rows) and c in range(cols) and grid[r][c] == 1:
                        deque.append([r, c])
                        rotting += 1
                        grid[r][c] = 2
            mins += 1

        return mins if total == rotting else -1
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(m * n)$, `m, n` are the dimensions of `grid`. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(m * n)$
