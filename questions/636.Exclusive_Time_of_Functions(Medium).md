### Question:
On a **single-threaded** CPU, we execute a program containing `n` functions. Each function has a unique ID between `0` and `n-1`.

Function calls are **stored in** a call stack: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is **the current function being executed**. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.

You are given a list `logs`, where `logs[i]` represents the `ith` log message formatted as a string `"{function_id}:{"start" | "end"}:{timestamp}"`. For example, `"0:start:3"` means a function call with function ID `0` **started at the beginning** of timestamp `3`, and `"1:end:2"` means a function call with function ID `1` **ended at the end** of timestamp `2`. Note that a function can be called **multiple times, possibly recursively**.

A function's **exclusive time** is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for `2` time units and another call executing for `1` time unit, the **exclusive time** is `2 + 1 = 3`.

Return the **exclusive time** of each function in an array, where the value at the `ith` index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID `i`.

**Example 1:**

<img src="../images/636.png" width=600>

> **Input:** n = 2, logs = ["0:start:0","1:start:2","1:end:5","0:end:6"]
> 
> **Output:** [3,4]
>
> **Explanation:** <br>
> Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of time and reaches the end of time 1. <br>
> Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5. <br>
> Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time. <br>
> So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** n = 1, logs = ["0:start:0","0:start:2","0:end:5","0:start:6","0:end:6","0:end:7"]
> 
> **Output:** [8]
>
> **Explanation:** <br>
> Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself. <br>
> Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time. <br>
> Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again. <br>
> Function 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time. <br>
> Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and executes for 1 unit of time. <br>
> So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing.

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** n = 2, logs = ["0:start:0","0:start:2","0:end:5","1:start:6","1:end:6","0:end:7"]
> 
> **Output:** [7,1]
>
> **Explanation:** <br>
> Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself. <br>
> Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time. <br>
> Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1. <br>
> Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 unit of time, and ends at the end of time 6. <br>
> Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2 units of time. <br>
> So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 1 unit of total time executing.

**Edge Case:**
> **Input:** n = 3, logs = ["0:start:0","1:start:2","2:start:3","2:end:4","1:end:5","0:end:6"]
> 
> **Output:** [3,2,2]

**Edge Case:**
> **Input:** n = 3, logs = ["0:start:0","1:start:1","1:end:2","2:start:3","2:end:4","0:end:5"]
> 
> **Output:** [2,2,2]

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= n <= 100`

* `1 <= logs.length <= 500`

* `0 <= function_id < n`

* `0 <= timestamp <= 10^9`

* No two start events will happen at the same timestamp.

* No two end events will happen at the same timestamp.

* Each function has an `"end"` log for each `"start"` log.

<br>

### Walk-through: 
1. Use `stack[]` to keep track of ids. And `res[]` to keep track of total execution times for each index `i`.

2. Split `log` into `Id, status, pos`. We first check if `status == 'start'`, then check if `stack[]` is empty or not, if not, we add the difference `pos - prevPos` to previous index `stack[-1]`, and append new index into `stack[]` and update `prevPos = pos`. <br> If `status == end`, we update prev index `stack.pop()` by `pos - prevPos + 1`, then we update `prevPos = pos + 1` (Otherwise it will increment (`6-5+1 = 2`) for `res[1]`, instead of just `1`).

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def exclusiveTime(self, n: int, logs: List[str]) -> List[int]:
        # Save id into stack[], and res[i] ith func time
        # If status is 'start': curPos - prevPos to prev id. Then, update prevPos = curPos, append curId to stack
        # If status is 'end': pop to get the prev id, and update prev id by curPos-prevPos+1, and prevPos = curPos + 1

        # TC: O(n), n=len(logs), SC: O(n)
        stack, prevPos = [], 0
        res = [0] * n
        for log in logs:
            Id, status, pos = log.split(":")
            Id, pos = int(Id), int(pos)
            # For 'start', update the previous id just by pos - prevPos
            if status == 'start':
                # If it has previous start, update previous id
                if stack:
                    res[stack[-1]] += pos - prevPos
                stack.append(Id)
                prevPos = pos
            # For 'end', use current pos -  prevPos + 1
            else:
                res[stack.pop()] += pos - prevPos + 1
                prevPos = pos + 1
        return res
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$
