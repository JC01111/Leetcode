## 2551. Put Marbles in Bags (Hard)
**Date and Time:** Apr 9, 2025

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/put-marbles-in-bags

<br>

**Edge Case 1:**
> **Input:** weights = [1,3,5,1], k = 1 <br>
> **Output:** 0 <br>
> **Explanation:** The distribution for maximal and minimal scores will be [1,3,5,1], and the results will be (1+1) - (1+1) = 0

<br>

### Walk-through: 
Observation: we always need to take the beginning and the end of weights to calculate no matter maximum or minimum scores. Also, if we need to split weights into k groups, we need to find k-1 consecutive cuts. And we can observe the total scores with these splits will be the beginning + end + sum of two values around each split.

Use maxHeap and minHeap to store two values sum around each possible cut, always keep space with k-1 elements

return difference by k-1 biggest elements - k-1 smallest elements, remember to negate the sum of minHeap.

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def putMarbles(self, weights: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Observation: we always need to take the beginning and the end of weights for maximum and minimum scores. Also, if we need to split weights into k groups, we need to find k-1 consecutive cuts. And we can observe the total scores of these splits will be the beginning + end + sum of two values around each split.
        # Use maxHeap and minHeap to store two values sum around each possible cut, always keep space with k-1 elements
        # return difference by k-1 biggest elements - k-1 smallest elements
        
        # TC: O(nlogk), n=len(weights), SC: O(k)
        maxHeap, minHeap = [], []
        for i in range(len(weights)-1):
            val = weights[i] + weights[i+1]
            # Update maxHeap
            heapq.heappush(maxHeap, val)
            if len(maxHeap) > k-1:
                heapq.heappop(maxHeap)
            # Update minHeap
            heapq.heappush(minHeap, -val)
            if len(minHeap) > k-1:
                heapq.heappop(minHeap)
        # Don't forget to negate the sum of minHeap
        return sum(maxHeap) - (-sum(minHeap))
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(nlog(k))$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(k)$
