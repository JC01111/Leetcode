### Question:
Given a __1-indexed__ array of integers `numbers` that is already _**sorted in non-decreasing order**_, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.

Return _the indices of the two numbers, _`index1` and `index2`_, **added by one** as an integer array `[index1, index2]` of length 2_.

The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**. You **may not** use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
> 
> **Output:** [1, 2]
>
> **Explanation:** The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** numbers = [2, 3, 4], target = 6
> 
> **Output:** [1, 3]
>
> **Explanation:** The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** numbers = [-1, 0], target = -1
> 
> **Output:** [1, 2]
>
> **Explanation:** The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

### Confusion:
The solution asks for constant extra space, which is $O(1)$ space complexity.

<br>

### My Solution:
I don't understand why this question is Medium, because it is literally the dP solution of **Two Sum** with indices + 1.

Edit: This solution requires $O(n)$ space complexity, since it creates a dictionary to store elements.

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        dP = {}
        for i in range(len(numbers)):
            sub = target - numbers[i]
            if sub in dP:
                return [dP[sub]+1, i+1]
            else:
                dP[numbers[i]] = i
```
Time Complexity: $O(n)$ <br>
Space Complexity: $O(n)$

<br>

### Alternative Solution:
This solution uses two pointers method to first calculate the sum of left, right pointer. Since the `numbers` list is in **non-decreasing order**, so if `sum < target`,  we can increment the left ptr to increase `sum`. In the `else` case, if `sum > target`, decrement the right ptr to make `sum` smaller.

The two pointer method doesn't require to create a new list or dictionary, so it only uses $O(1)$ space complexity, which satisfies the constant space complexity requirement.
```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        left = 0
        right = len(numbers)-1
        # Sum of two nums and compare with target
        while left < right:
            sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
            if sum == target:
                return [left+1, right+1]
            # Increment left since numbers in non-decreasing order
            elif sum < target:
                left += 1
            # When sum > target, we decrement the right index
            else:
                right -= 1
```
Time Complexity: $O(n)$ <br>
Space Complexity: $O(1)$
