### Question:
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

* After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).

**Note**: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** prices = [1,2,3,0,2]
> 
> **Output:** 3
>
> **Explanation:** transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** prices = [1]
> 
> **Output:** 0

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= prices.length <= 5000`

* `0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
**1D DP:**
1. We use `dfs()` to loop over the `prices`, at first we check if `i` is out of bound, so we can return `0`. Then, we check if `(i, has_stock)` is in `dp`, so we can just return the value in dp. 

2. There are two cases, either we have stock or not. If we have stock, we find the max of two cases: <br>
i. we `sell` the stock (`has_stock == True`), we will have `sell = dfs(i+2, False) + prices[i]`, because if we sell it, we will have no stock, which is `False`, and we have to jump to `i+2` because of the cooldown, then the profit of sell will need to add `prices[i]`. <br>
`cooldown` should be `dfs(i+1, True)`, because we assume we take cooldown at `i`, but we still have stock. <br> <br>
ii. we `buy` stock (`has_stock == False`), and `buy = dfs(i+1, True) - prices[i]`, after we buy the stock, we have stock at `i+1`, which we can perform sell or cooldown. We need to minus the profit of buy by `prices[i]` because we buy the stock.  <br>
`cooldown` should be `dfs(i+1, False)` because we don't have stock at `i`. 

3. In each case of `buy` or `sell`, we update `dp[(i, has_stock)]` with the max profit of `max(buy, cooldown)` or `max(sell, cooldown)`.

**2D DP:**
1. We build a 2d DP table of `2 x (len(prices) + 2)`. The first row indictates the `buy` state, the second row is for the `sell` state.

2. We update the dp table from right to left, we start from the last price `i`. For buy row `dp[0][i]`, we take the maximum of two scenarios: **i.** buy now and sell later (`dp[1][i+1] - prices[i]`), we look at the sell state for the profit if we sell it later and minus the price we buy the stock today. **ii.** buy later (`dp[0][i+1]`), look at the buy state for tomorrow. And we just take the maximum profit as the value of `dp[0][i]`.

3. For sell row `dp[1][i]`, we take the maximum of two scenarios: **i.** sell now and buy later (`dp[0][i+2] + prices[i]`), we look at the buy state for `i+2` because we have to skip one day for cooldown, and we just add the profit of selling at `prices[i]` (This is also the reason why we need to have two extra cols of `0` as the base case). **ii.** sell later (`dp[1][i+1]`), look at the profit if we sell it later.

4. Finally, we return `dp[0][0]` for the final profit, because we have to buy at day `0`, which makes sense to look at buy state [0].

### Python 1d DP Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = {}     # ((i, buy) : curr_profit)
        def dfs(i, has_stock):
            if i >= len(prices):
                return 0
            if (i, has_stock) in dp:
                return dp[(i, has_stock)]
            if has_stock:
                sell = dfs(i+2, False) + prices[i]
                cooldown = dfs(i+1, True)
                dp[(i, has_stock)] = max(sell, cooldown)
            else:
                buy = dfs(i+1, True) - prices[i]
                cooldown = dfs(i+1, False)
                dp[(i, has_stock)] = max(buy, cooldown)
            return dp[(i, has_stock)]
        return dfs(0, False)
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, length of `prices`. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$

<br>

### Python 2d DP Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [[0] * (len(prices)+2) for _ in range(2)]
        for i in range(len(prices)-1, -1, -1):
            dp[0][i] = max(dp[1][i+1]-prices[i], dp[0][i+1])
            dp[1][i] = max(dp[0][i+2]+prices[i], dp[1][i+1])
        return dp[0][0]
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, this is still $O(n)$ because $O(2 * n)$ -> $O(n)$.
