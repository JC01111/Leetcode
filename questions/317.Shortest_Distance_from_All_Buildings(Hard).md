## 317. Shortest Distance from All Buildings (Hard)
**Date and Time:** May 9, 2025

<br>

### Walk-through: 
We can run BFS on each building `1` to all empty land `0`, and we use a hashmap to save each `0`'s position with its `[steps, buildings]`, where we use steps to keep track of the total steps that each building `1` to reach there and `buildings` to record how many buildings will pass this empty island.

Finally, loop over hashmap and check if `0`'s building has met the requirement and we update `ans` with the minimum `steps.`

### Python:
```python
class Solution:
    def shortestDistance(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Q: Return the shortest distance from a grid to all buildings
        # S: run BFS from 1 to all 0, create a new hashmap {(r, c): [steps, buildings]} to store each grid's [steps, buildings], if we run bfs from 1, increment each 0's buildings
        # Loop over hashmap to check if buildings is met, update steps with the minimum
        # TC: O(m^2 * n^2), SC: O(m*n)

        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        hashmap = {}    # {pos of 0: [steps, buildings]}
        # Loop over grid to find 1 and run BFS
        directions = [[-1, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]]
        def bfs(r, c):
            deque = collections.deque([(r, c, 0)])
            visited = set()
            visited.add((r, c))
            while deque:
                r, c, steps = deque.popleft()
                for dr, dc in directions:
                    row, col = r+dr, c+dc
                    if (row, col) not in visited and row in range(rows) and col in range(cols) and grid[row][col] == 0:
                        # Add steps to (row, col) and increment buildings by 1
                        # Intialize hashmap
                        hashmap[(row, col)] = hashmap.get((row, col), [0, 0])
                        hashmap[(row, col)][0] += steps + 1
                        hashmap[(row, col)][1] += 1
                        visited.add((row, col))
                        deque.append([row, col, steps+1])
        # Call BFS on each 1
        ones = 0
        ans = float("inf")
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == 1:
                    ones += 1
                    bfs(r, c)
        # Loop over hashmap to find the minimum steps
        for _, vals in hashmap.items():
            steps, buildings = vals
            if buildings == ones:
                ans = min(ans, steps)
        return ans if ans != float("inf") else -1
