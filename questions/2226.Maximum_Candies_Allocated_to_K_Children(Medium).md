### Question:
You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `candies`. Each element in the array denotes a pile of candies of size `candies[i]`. You can divide each pile into any number of **sub piles**, but you **cannot** merge two piles together.

You are also given an integer `k`. You should allocate piles of candies to `k` children such that each child gets the **same** number of candies. Each child can be allocated candies from **only one** pile of candies and some piles of candies may go unused.

Return the **maximum number of candies** each child can get.

<br>

**Hint 1:** For a fixed number of candies c, how can you check if each child can get c candies?

**Hint 2:** Use binary search to find the maximum c as the answer.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** candies = [5,8,6], k = 3 <br>
> **Output:** 5 <br>
> **Explanation:** We can divide candies[1] into 2 piles of size 5 and 3, and candies[2] into 2 piles of size 5 and 1. We now have five piles of candies of sizes 5, 5, 3, 5, and 1. We can allocate the 3 piles of size 5 to 3 children. It can be proven that each child cannot receive more than 5 candies.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** candies = [2,5], k = 11 <br>
> **Output:** 0 <br>
> **Explanation:** There are 11 children but only 7 candies in total, so it is impossible to ensure each child receives at least one candy. Thus, each child gets no candy and the answer is 0.

<br>

#### Constraints:
* $1 <= candies.length <= 10^5$

* $1 <= candies[i] <= 10^7$

* $1 <= k <= 10^{12}$

<br>

### Walk-through: 
We can run binary search on range `[1, max(candies)]` to find the candies `m` and for each pile `i` in `candies`, we calculate `tmp += i // m`, and check if `tmp >= k`, then we can update `ans = tmp`. Next, update `l, r` accordingly.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def maximumCandies(self, candies: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Run Binary Search on the range [1, max(candies)], pick candies c from here
        # For each candy // m to see if total pile can be divided by m candies for k children. Update l, r accordingly

        # TC: O(nlog(m)), n=len(candies), m=max(candies), SC: O(1)
        l, r = 1, max(candies)      # [1, max(candies)]
        ans = 0
        while l <= r:
            m = (l+r) // 2
            tmp = 0
            # Calculate how many children get m candies
            for i in candies:
                tmp += i // m
            # If not enough for k children, look for greater m
            if tmp >= k:
                ans = m
                l = m + 1
            else:
                r = m - 1
        return ans
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(nlog(m))$, we run binary search and iterate `candies` everytime. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
