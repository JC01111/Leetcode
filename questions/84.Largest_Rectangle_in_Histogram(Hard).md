<br>

### Question:
Given an array of integers `heights` representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is `1`, return _the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram_.

<br>

**Example 1:**

<img src="../images/84_1.jpg" width=500>

> **Input:** heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
> 
> **Output:** 10
>
> **Explanation:** The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1. The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.

**Example 2:**

<img src="../images/84_2.jpg" width=200>

> **Input:** heights = [2,4]
> 
> **Output:** 4

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= heights.length <= 10^5`

* `0 <= heights[i] <= 10^4`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
Use `stack[]` to save `[index, height]` until the current height is less than previous height in stack `stack[-1][1]`. Then we need to calculate the area of previous height by `height * (i - index)`, and append new height into stack `[index, height]`, because previous index can contribute to this height. (`i` is current height's index, `index` is the previous height's index we pop from stack)

Lastly, we may encounter `heights` are increasing or the last parts are increasing. We just calculate the area by `height * (len(heights) - i)`, because they are all increasing, means heigh come after this current height are all greater or equal to this height, and there are `len(heights) - i` of them.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        # Save all numbers and its index into stack
        # Until current height < stack[-1][1]
        # Calculate that area with i - index (from stack)
        # Update start = index
        # Append((start, h)), because the prev index we pop from stack can be extended with this current height h

        # TC: O(n), SC: O(n)
        stack = []
        area = 0
        for i, height in enumerate(heights):
            start = i
            while stack and stack[-1][1] > height:
                index, prevHeight = stack.pop()
                area = max(area, prevHeight * (i - index))
                start = index
            stack.append([start, height])
        
        # Case when heights are increasing or the last parts of heights are increasing
        for i, height in stack:
            area = max(area, (len(heights) - i) * height)
        return area
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, we only loop over `heights`, and `pop()` from `stack[]` only takes $O(1)$. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$
