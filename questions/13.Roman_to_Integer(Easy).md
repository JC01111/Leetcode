### Question:
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

* `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. 

* `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. 

* `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** s = "III" <br>
> **Output:** 3 <br>
> **Explanation:** III = 3.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** s = "LVIII" <br>
> **Output:** 58 <br>
> **Explanation:** L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** s = "MCMXCIV" <br>
> **Output:** 1994 <br>
> **Explanation:** M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= s.length <= 15`

* `s` contains only the characters `('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M')`.

* It is **guaranteed** that `s` is a valid roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`.

<br>

### Walk-through: 

**Intuitive Solution:**

We first store all 7 Roman numerals into `roman{}`. Then, we loop over `s` from the back. We check two things:

1. If any of the subtraction cases mentioned in the question happen, we update `res` with the previous Roman's integer value - current Roman's integer value. And we move forward `i` index by two.

2. The normal case, we don't need to subtract. We just update `res` with current Roman integer's value, and move forward update `i += 1`.

<br>

**Simplified Solution:**

We observe that `IV = V - I = -I + V = 4`, which is equal to we first process `I`, if we detect `i+1` is in-bound, and `roman[s[i]] < roman[s[i+1]]`, we can first subtract `res -= roman[s[i]]`, then add `res += roman[s[i+1]]` in the next for loop.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        roman = {'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000}
        # if V, X, L, C, D, M, check their previous roman numeral
        res = 0
        i = len(s)-1
        while i >= 0:
            if ((i-1 >= 0) and 
                ((s[i-1] == 'I' and (s[i] == 'V' or s[i] == 'X')) 
            or ((s[i-1] == 'I' and (s[i] == 'V' or s[i] == 'X')))
            or ((s[i-1] == 'X' and (s[i] == 'L' or s[i] == 'C')))
            or ((s[i-1] == 'C' and (s[i] == 'D' or s[i] == 'M')))
            )):
                res += roman[s[i]] - roman[s[i-1]]
                i -= 2
            else:
                res += roman[s[i]]
                i -= 1
        return res
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, `n` is the length of `s`. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, we only store 7 Roman numerals.

### Python Optimized Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        roman = {'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000}
        res = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if i + 1 < len(s) and roman[s[i]] < roman[s[i+1]]:
                res -= roman[s[i]]
            else:
                res += roman[s[i]]
        return res
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
