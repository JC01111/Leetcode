## 836. Rectangle Overlap (Easy)
**Date and Time:** Apr 1, 2025

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-overlap

<br>

**Edge Case 1:**
> **Input:** rec1 = [1,1,3,3], rec2 = [0,0,2,2] <br>
> **Output:** true <br>

<br>

### Walk-through: 
We check check if `rec1` is on the left/right/top/bottom of `rec2`. If `rec1` is on the left/right of `rec2`, we know they will not overlap on the `x` axis, and there is no way to overlap on `y` axis as well. Same as checking the top/bottom, so the y axis will not overlap, and it doesn't matter for x axis. 

If `rec1` is not left/right/top/bottom of `rec2`, they must overlap.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def isRectangleOverlap(self, rec1: List[int], rec2: List[int]) -> bool:
        # Pick rec2 as center, check if rec1 is around rec2 by its left, right, top, bottom. If none of them is true, they must overlap
        # x: rec1[2] <= rec2[0] (rec1 is on the left of rec2)
        # x: rec1[0] >= rec2[2] (rec1 is on the right of rec2)
        # y: rec1[1] >= rec2[3] (rec1 is on the top of rec2)
        # y: rec1[3] <= rec2[1] (rec1 is on the bottom of rec2)

        # TC: O(1), SC: O(1)
        return not (rec1[2] <= rec2[0] or 
                    rec1[0] >= rec2[2] or
                    rec1[1] >= rec2[3] or
                    rec1[3] <= rec2[1])
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(1)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
