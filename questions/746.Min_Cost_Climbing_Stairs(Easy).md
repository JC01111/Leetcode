<br>

### Question:
You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of `ith` step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index `0`, or the step with index `1`.

Return _the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor_.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** cost = [10,<u>15</u>,20]
> 
> **Output:** 15
>
> **Explanation:** You will start at index 1. <br>
> \- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top. <br>
> The total cost is 15.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** cost = [<u>1</u>,100,<u>1</u>,1,<u>1</u>,100,<u>1</u>,<u>1</u>,100,<u>1</u>]
> 
> **Output:** 6
>
> **Explanation:** You will start at index 0. <br>
> \- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2. <br>
> \- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4. <br>
> \- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6. <br>
> \- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7. <br>
> \- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9. <br>
> \- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top. <br>
> The total cost is 6.

#### Constraints:
* `2 <= cost.length <= 1000`

* `0 <= cost[i] <= 999`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
Follow the hints:

1. Build an array dp where dp[i] is the minimum cost to climb to the top starting from the ith staircase.

2. Assuming we have n staircase labeled from 0 to n - 1 and assuming the top is n, then dp[n] = 0, marking that if you are at the top, the cost is 0.

3. Now, looping from n - 1 to 0, the dp[i] = cost[i] + min(dp[i + 1], dp[i + 2]). The answer will be the minimum of dp[0] and dp[1]

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (len(cost) + 1)
        dp[len(cost)-1] = cost[-1]
        for i in range(len(cost)-2, -1, -1):
            dp[i] = cost[i] + min(dp[i+1], dp[i+2])
        return min(dp[0], dp[1])
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$
