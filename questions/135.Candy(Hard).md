### Question:
There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

* Each child must have at least one candy.

* Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return _the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children_.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** ratings = [1,0,2]
> 
> **Output:** 5
>
> **Explanation:** You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** ratings = [1,2,2]
> 
> **Output:** 4
>
> **Explanation:** You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively. <br>
> The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `n == ratings.length`

* `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4`

* `0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 10^4`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
1. We are given two requirements, to satisfy the first requirement, we can first initialize an array `candy = [1] * len(ratings)`.

2. Since the children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors, we can first loop over `ratings` from left to right ane detect if an element in `ratings` is greater than its left neighbor, if so, we update the `candy[i] = candy[i-1]+1`, because we want to have higher value than its neighbor.

3. We do the same thing from the right to the left and check if an element is greater than its right neighbor. If so, we want to update `candy[i] = max(candy[i], candy[i+1]+1)`, we don't want to replace `candy[i]` with a value lower than its original `candy[i]`.

4. Finally, we just return the sum of `candy[]`.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        # 1. From left to right, make sure elem > its left nei
        # 2. From right to left, make sure elem > its right nei
        candy = [1] * len(ratings)

        for i in range(1, len(ratings)):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i-1]:
                candy[i] = candy[i-1] + 1

        for i in range(len(ratings)-2, -1, -1):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i+1]:
                candy[i] = max(candy[i], candy[i+1] + 1)

        return sum(candy)
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, `n` is the length of `ratings`. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$
