### Question:
You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`. All the strings of `words` are of **the same length**.

A **concatenated string** is a string that exactly contains all the strings of any permutation of `words` concatenated.

* For example, if `words = ["ab","cd","ef"]`, then `"abcdef"`, `"abefcd"`, `"cdabef"`, `"cdefab"`, `"efabcd"`, and `"efcdab"` are all concatenated strings. `"acdbef"` is not a concatenated string because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of `words`.

Return an array of the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in `s`. You can return the answer in **any order**.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:**  s = "barfoothefoobarman", words = ["foo","bar"]
> 
> **Output:** [0,9]
>
> **Explanation:** <br>
> The substring starting at 0 is "barfoo". It is the concatenation of ["bar","foo"] which is a permutation of words. <br>
> The substring starting at 9 is "foobar". It is the concatenation of ["foo","bar"] which is a permutation of words.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword", words = ["word","good","best","word"]
> 
> **Output:** []
>
> **Explanation:** <br>
> There is no concatenated substring.

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** s = "barfoofoobarthefoobarman", words = ["bar","foo","the"]
> 
> **Output:** [6,9,12]
>
> **Explanation:** <br>
> The substring starting at 6 is "foobarthe". It is the concatenation of ["foo","bar","the"]. <br>
> The substring starting at 9 is "barthefoo". It is the concatenation of ["bar","the","foo"]. <br>
> The substring starting at 12 is "thefoobar". It is the concatenation of ["the","foo","bar"].

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`

* `1 <= words.length <= 5000`

* `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`

* `s` and `words[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.

### Walk-through: 
1. Use `word_counts{}` to record each word in `words` and their occurancy. 

2. Start from `range(word_len)` (we can form substring starting from range(0, word_len) and each time we step by word_len), we create `l = i, counts = 0, sub_counts{}`. And we check from `l` to `r in range(l, len(s)-word_len + 1, word_len)`, so each increment of `r` will let us create a `sub_word` and we check if this `sub_word` in `word_counts` or not. 

3. In the for loop, we want to check the range of `l, r` and find if the words in this range equal to the counts of `counts`, and if we detect repeated word in this range, ie. `sub_counts[sub_word] > word_counts[sub_word]`, we increment `l += word_len` and decrement `counts -= 1`. Later, if we find equal `counts == len(words)`, we find a substring of all words, and we append this `l` index to `res[]`.

4. If a current `sub_word` does not exist in `word_counts`, we need to increment `l = r + word_len` and clear `sub_counts{}`, reset `counts = 0`.

5. Finally, return `res`.

<br>

Example 1: from index 0, we can form `substring = barfoothefoobarm`, so we can find any valid concatenation from this substring. Later, we go to index 1, we can form `arfoothefoobarma`, for index 2, we can form `rfoothefoobarman`. This is how we use `range(word_len)` to find all the concatenations.

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def findSubstring(self, s: str, words: List[str]) -> List[int]:
        # Count words frequency
        # start from each index of s, try if we can find all words from i
        # if yes, append i to res, otherwise, continue
        # if word in curr_counts > word_counts, decrement by moving l

        # TC: O(n^2), SC: O(n)
        res = []
        word_counts = {}
        word_len = len(words[0])
        for word in words:
            word_counts[word] = word_counts.get(word, 0) + 1
        
        for i in range(word_len):
            l = i
            counts = 0
            sub_counts = {}
            # Check sub_word
            for r in range(l, len(s) - word_len + 1, word_len):
                sub_word = s[r:r + word_len]
                # Check if sub_word exists in word_counts
                if sub_word in word_counts:
                    sub_counts[sub_word] = sub_counts.get(sub_word, 0) + 1
                    counts += 1
                    # If repeated word found, shrink the window from left
                    while sub_counts[sub_word] > word_counts[sub_word]:
                        sub_counts[s[l:l + word_len]] -= 1
                        l += word_len
                        counts -= 1

                    if counts == len(words):
                        res.append(l)
                # If sub_word doesn't exist, update l
                else:
                    l = r + word_len
                    sub_counts.clear()
                    counts = 0
        return res
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$
