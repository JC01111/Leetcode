<br>

### Question:
Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper, return _the researcher's h-index_.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of `h` such that the given researcher has published at least `h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** citations = [3,0,6,1,5] <br>
> **Output:** 3 <br>
> **Explanation:** [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. <br>
> Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** citations = [1,3,1] <br>
> **Output:** 1

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `n == citations.length`

* `1 <= n <= 5000`

* `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
**1. Sorting**

We sort `citations` in descending order. Then we `enumerate(citations)` to get the index and citations for each index. We know when `index >= c` is the maximum `h` we can get (it means at least `i` papers have `i` citations.). Otherwise, we just return `len(citations)`, because `h` cannot exceed the number of papers we have, so the maximum we can have is `len(citations)`, which means we have `len(citations)` papers.

```
Example 1:
# citations = [6, 5, 3, 1, 0]
# index =     [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

Example 2:
# [5, 4, 4, 4]
# [0, 1, 2, 3]
```

<br>

**2. counts**

In this approach, we create a list `counts[]` with range `[0, len(citations) + 1]` (because h-index will not exceed the number of papers (len(citations))) and update each index with the number of papers that have "index" citation number, so index 0 means how many papers have 0 citations, and the last index means how many paper have at least the last index's citation. 

After we loop over `citations`, we can start from backward, and we have two variables `h = len(citations)` and `papers` which is current number of papers we have. We return until we have `papers >= h`.

```
Example:
citations = [5, 1, 2, 8, 9, 3], counts = [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2] 
                                          0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
                                h = 3, papers = 4
```

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
        # Sort citations in descending order, find when index >= citation

        # TC: O(nlogn), n = len(citations), SC: O(1)
        citations.sort(reverse=True)
        for i, citation in enumerate(citations):
            if i >= citation:
                return i
        return len(citations)
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(nlog\ n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

<br>

### Python Optimized Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(citations)
        counts = [0] * (n + 1)
        for c in citations:
            counts[min(c, n)] += 1

        h, papers = n, counts[n]
        while papers < h:
            h -= 1
            papers += counts[h]
        return h
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$
