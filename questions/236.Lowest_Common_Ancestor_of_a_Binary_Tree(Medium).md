### Question:
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in T that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

<br>

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
> 
> **Output:** 3
>
> **Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

**Example 2:**

<img src="../images/236_2.png" width=250>

> **Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
> 
> **Output:** 5
>
> **Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
> 
> **Output:** 1

#### Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 10^5]`.

* `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`

* All `Node.val` are **unique**.

* `p != q`

* `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.

<br>

### KeyPoints: 
There will be only three scenarios: 1. root is the LCA of `p`, `q` on two sides (Example 1). 2. `p` is the LCA of `p` and `q` (Example 2). 3. `q` is the LCA of `p` and `q` (in the same tree, think about `p = 0`, `q = 1`). 

We can use recursion to traverse from root to left then to right. In the first scenario, if `3` is the root, we first recurse on `root.left`, so we get `l = 5`, then we recurse on `root.right`, so `r = 1`, and we know `l, r` are both not `None`. Hence, we can return node.

For the rest two scenarios, the logic is that it will only find either `l` or `r`, if `p` is LCA, it will stop traversing its left-subtree, because we will `return root`, so we return back to `root` and traverse on `root.right` but if `p` is LCA, we won't find `q` on `root.right` because it may be blocked by `l` we found. So we just return `l` or `r` that exists in the tree.

### My Solution:
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        if not root:
            return
        if root == p or root == q:
            return root
        l = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        r = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        # When root = 3, l = 5, r = 1, return 3
        if l and r:
            return root
        else:
            return l or r
```
