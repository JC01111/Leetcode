### Question:
A **transformation sequence** from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s_1 -> s_2 -> ... -> s_k` such that:

* Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.

* Every `s_i` for `1 <= i <= k` is in wordList. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`.

* `s_k == endWord`

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return _the **number of words** in the **shortest transformation sequence** from `beginWord` to `endWord`, or `0` if no such sequence exists_.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
> 
> **Output:** 5
>
> **Explanation:** One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
> 
> **Output:** 0
>
> **Explanation:** The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= beginWord.length <= 10`

* `endWord.length == beginWord.length`

* `1 <= wordList.length <= 5000`

* `wordList[i].length == beginWord.length`

* `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.

* `beginWord != endWord`

* All the words in `wordList` are **unique**.

<br>

### Walk-through: 
1. Build an adjacent dictionary for all patterns of each word in `wordList`. E.g. `hot: *ot, h*t, ho*`, then we map each pattern into the dicionary with the word: `{'*ot': hot, dot, lot}`. 

2. We use `visited(), deque[]` to keep track of the word we visited while we are running **bfs**, and use `deque[]` to store current word's all patterns from the adjacent dictionary for next iteration.

3. We increment `res` after we check all the elements in `deque[]` because deque contains only the same pattern words.

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def ladderLength(self, beginWord: str, endWord: str, wordList: List[str]) -> int:
        adj = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for word in wordList:
            for i in range(len(word)):
                pattern = word[:i] + "*" + word[i+1:]
                adj[pattern].append(word)
        
        deque, visited = collections.deque([beginWord]), set()
        visited.add(beginWord)
        res = 1
        while deque:
            for _ in range(len(deque)):
                word = deque.popleft()
                if word == endWord:
                    return res
                for i in range(len(word)):
                    pattern = word[:i] + "*" + word[i+1:]
                    for nei in adj[pattern]:
                        if nei not in visited:
                            deque.append(nei)
                            visited.add(nei)
            res += 1
        return 0
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n^2 * m)$, where `m` is the length of each `word`, `n` is the number of word in `wordList`, because we store `n` words and compare `n` words, resulting in $O(n^2)$. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n * m)$, we only store all `n` words into dictionary in the worst case, each `word` with `m` length.
