### Question:
Suppose LeetCode will start its **IPO** soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the **IPO**. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most `k` distinct projects before the **IPO**. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most `k` distinct projects.

You are given `n` projects where the `ith` project has a pure profit `profits[i]` and a minimum capital of `capital[i]` is needed to start it.

Initially, you have `w` capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.

Pick a list of **at most** `k` distinct projects from given projects to **maximize your final capital**, and return _the final maximized capital_.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]
> 
> **Output:** 4
>
> **Explanation:** Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0. <br>
> After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1. <br>
> With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2. <br>
> Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital. <br>
> Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** k = 3, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,2]
> 
> **Output:** 6

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= k <= 10^5`

* `0 <= w <= 10^9`

* `n == profits.length`

* `n == capital.length`

* `1 <= n <= 10^5`

* `0 <= profits[i] <= 10^4`

* `0 <= capital[i] <= 10^9`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
1. `maxHeap` to store all profits that we can take (all `capital[i] <= w`). `minHeap` to store the pairs of `[capital[i], profits[i]]`, when `minHeap[0][0] <= w` (`capital[i] <= w`), we can append these profits to `maxHeap`.

2. We can compare the value of required `capital` of `minHeap`, then repeatedly add all satisfied `profits` into `maxHeap`. Then, we check if `maxHeap` is empty or not to break the loop early. Otherwise, we just add negate of the top of `maxHeap` to `w`, and return this after `range(k)`.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def findMaximizedCapital(self, k: int, w: int, profits: List[int], capital: List[int]) -> int:
        minHeap, maxHeap = [(c, p) for c, p in zip(capital, profits)], []
        heapq.heapify(minHeap)
        
        for _ in range(k):
            while minHeap and minHeap[0][0] <= w:
                c, p = heapq.heappop(minHeap)
                heapq.heappush(maxHeap, -p)
            if not maxHeap:
                break
            w += -heapq.heappop(maxHeap)
        return w
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(k*log\ n)$, `k` is the number of times we run the `heappop()` and `heappush()`, each takes $O(log\ n)$ because we maintain a size of `n` heap. `n` is total projects. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$
