### Question:
Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the maximum number of consecutive_ `1`'_s in the array if you can flip at most_ `k` `0`'s.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
> 
> **Output:** 6
>
> **Explanation:** [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1] <br>
> Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
> 
> **Output:** 10
>
> **Explanation:** [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1] <br>
> Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`

* `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.

* `0 <= k <= nums.length`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
Use `l, r` pointer to keep track of a window's size. When `nums[r] == 0`, we decrement `k` until `k` is negative, then we can start shrinking the window while we are still expanding this window (we just keep the same current maxmimum window size by moving the window to the right by 1).

When `nums[l] == 0`, we can increment `k += 1`, until `k >= 0` we can start expanding the window again.

Finally, since we will keep the current maximum window's length, so until the end of the list, we can just return `r - l + 1`, which is the maximum size of the window we have.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # When k is negative, update l += 1, if nums[l] == 0, k += 1, same as moving the window to the right by 1
        # return r - l + 1 in the end, because we will always keep the same size of the max window

        # TC: O(n), SC: O(1)
        l = 0
        for r in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[r] == 0:
                k -= 1
            if k < 0:
                if nums[l] == 0:
                    k += 1
                l += 1
        return r - l + 1
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
