<br>

### Question:
You are given an array of integers `nums`, there is a sliding window of size `k` which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the `k` numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return _the max sliding window_.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
> 
> **Output:** [3,3,5,5,6,7]
>
> **Explanation:**
```
Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7
```

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`

* `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

* `1 <= k <= nums.length`

<br>

### KeyPoints: 
This question uses **monotonic decreasing queue** to solve. The **deque** can make sure the queue is always keeping the max of a window and is always decreasing (because new max will replace all elements < new max). 

`deque` is used to record the index of `nums`, because we need to use it to update `l`, when `l > deque[0]`, it means the deque has moved and we should update `l`. 

So in the while loop for `r`, we repeatly check if `new element > deque's last element`, so we can make sure we always keep max. After the first inner while loop, we check if `l > deque's first index` to check if the first index in `deque` is outdated and should be removed. Lastly, if r + 1 is outside of the first window, we can start appending the first element in deque (max in window), and move window by 1.

### Naive Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        # Inefficient, O(k * (n-k))
        l, r = 0, 0
        res = []
        while l <= len(nums) - k:
            r = l + k - 1
            tmp = nums[l]
            for i in range(l, r + 1):
                tmp = max(tmp, nums[i])
            res.append(tmp)
            l += 1
        return res
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(k * (n - k))$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$

<br>

### My Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        deque = collections.deque()
        l, res = 0, []
        for r in range(len(nums)):
            # Check if new element is greater than deque's last element
            # In that case we can make sure we always keep max in deque
            while deque and nums[r] >= nums[deque[-1]]:
                deque.pop()
            deque.append(r)
            # If l > deque's first index, remove it in deque
            if l > deque[0]:
                deque.popleft()
            # If r + 1 is outside of the first window, we can start
            # appending the first element in deque (max in window) to res,
            # and move window by 1
            if r + 1 >= k:
                res.append(nums[deque[0]])  # element not index
                l += 1
        return res
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$
