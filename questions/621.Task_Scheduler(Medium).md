### Question:
You are given an array of CPU `tasks`, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, `n`. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: **identical** tasks must be separated by at least `n` intervals due to cooling time.

â€‹Return the _minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks_.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
> 
> **Output:** 8
>
> **Explanation:** A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B. <br>
> After completing task A, you must wait two cycles before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th cycle, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1
> 
> **Output:** 6
>
> **Explanation:** A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B. <br>
> With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other task.

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3
> 
> **Output:** 10
>
> **Explanation:** A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B. <br>
> There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 intervals. This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks.

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= tasks.length <= 10^4`

* `tasks[i]` is an uppercase English letter.

* `0 <= n <= 100`

### Walk-through: 
**maxHeap Approach:**
1. save the counts of each task. And convert the counts into a maxHeap. We create a `deque()` so we can save the task with its cooldown time to the `deque`.

2. In the while loop, we incremenet the time and check if `maxHeap` has elements then we increment the current `cnt` (task), if new `cnt != 0`, we can append this task with `[cnt, time + n]` into `deque()`. Then we check the `deque()`, if `deque[0][1] == time`, so we know a previous task in `deque()` can be released back to `maxHeap`.

3. Finally, we just return the total time.

<br>

**Greedy Approach:**
1. Find the maximum counts elements are, and the maximum counts value. We can do it again by `Counter()` in Python.

2. We form intervals with the most frequent element's counts - 1, and each interval with `n+1` elements. <br> E.g. if n = 2, every interval goes like: [ _ , _ , _ ]. And we can form at most (max_frequent_elem_counts - 1) intervals, and each interval we can use (n + 1) elements, like [ A, _ , _ ] in Example 1.

3. Normally, the `max_frequent_elem_counts` should take the number of `max_frequent_elem_counts` lines, but we only use the `max_frequent_elem_counts - 1` lines, because we want to count all the `max_frequent_elem_counts` elements in the last line, so they can all be processed in one interval. 

4. Hence, we can count the total times by `(max_frequent_elem_counts - 1) * (n+1) + nums_of_max_elem_counts`, `nums_of_max_elem_counts` is just how many elements' counts = most counts.

5. In some cases, we can still arrange the scheduler so that it doesn't have two same tasks running before complete its idle time, hence the minimum task to be done is `len(tasks)`. So the final answer should be `max((max_frequent_elem_counts - 1) * (n+1) + nums_of_max_elem_counts, len(tasks))`

### Python maxHeap Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        count = Counter(tasks)
        maxHeap = [-i for i in count.values()]
        heapq.heapify(maxHeap)
        
        time = 0
        deque = collections.deque()
        while maxHeap or deque:
            time += 1
            if maxHeap:
                cnt = 1 + heapq.heappop(maxHeap)
                if cnt != 0:
                    deque.append([cnt, time + n])
            if deque and deque[0][1] == time:
                heapq.heappush(maxHeap, deque.popleft()[0])
        return time
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n * log\ 26) = O(n)$, `n` is the length of `tasks`, since we need to store the counts of each task, it takes $O(n)$. Then, we perform `heappop()` and `heappush()`, which takes $O(log\ n)$ each. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, because the maxHeap will have at most $O(26) = O(1)$.

<br>

### Python Greedy Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        counts = Counter(tasks)
        max_counts = max(counts.values())
        
        nums_max_counts = 0
        for val in counts.values():
            if val == max_counts:
                nums_max_counts += 1

        ans = (max_counts - 1) * (n + 1) + nums_max_counts
        return max(ans, len(tasks))
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
