<br>

### Question:
Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the words.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return _a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space._

Note that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** s = "the sky is blue"
> 
> **Output:** "blue is sky the"
>
> **Explanation:**

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** s = "  hello world  "
> 
> **Output:** "world hello"
>
> **Explanation:** Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** s = "a good   example"
> 
> **Output:** "example good a"
>
> **Explanation:** You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

<br>

#### Constraints:
* $1 <= \text{s.length} <= 10^4$

* `s` contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces `' '`.

* There is **at least one** word in s.

### KeyPoints: 
Again, it is easy to use built-in functions in Python. But we should also consider the non built-in functions version. 

I start from backward, while there is space, we just decrement `r`, if `s[r]` is not space, we add the character into a temporary variable `curr` and after we finish one word, we reverse `curr` by `[::-1]` and add it to `res` with a space before reversed `curr`. 

Lastly, we need to check if `curr` is not empty we append the word to `res`, otherwise in **Example 2** we will add an extra space to the end. And we just return `res[:len(res)-1]` because the last element is space.

### Naive Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        s = s.split()
        s = s[::-1]
        s = " ".join(s)
        return s
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

<br>

### Interview Type Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        r, res = len(s) - 1, ""
        while r >= 0:
            curr = ""
            while r >= 0 and s[r] == " ":
                r -= 1
            while r >= 0 and s[r] != " ":
                curr += s[r]
                r -= 1
            if curr:
                res += (curr[::-1] + " ")
        return res[:len(res)-1]
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$
