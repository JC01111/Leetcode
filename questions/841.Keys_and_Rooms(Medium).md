### Question:
There are `n` rooms labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and all the rooms are locked except for room `0`. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.

When you visit a room, you may find a set of **distinct keys** in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.

Given an array `rooms` where `rooms[i]` is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room `i`, return `true` _if you can visit **all** the rooms, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]
> 
> **Output:** true
>
> **Explanation:** <br>
> We visit room 0 and pick up key 1. <br>
> We then visit room 1 and pick up key 2. <br>
> We then visit room 2 and pick up key 3. <br>
> We then visit room 3. <br>
> Since we were able to visit every room, we return true.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
> 
> **Output:** false
>
> **Explanation:** We can not enter room number 2 since the only key that unlocks it is in that room.

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `n == rooms.length`

* `2 <= n <= 1000`

* `0 <= rooms[i].length <= 1000`

* `1 <= sum(rooms[i].length) <= 3000`

* `0 <= rooms[i][j] < n
`
* All the values of `rooms[i]` are **unique**.

<br>

### Walk-through: 
1. Use `visited()` a set to store all the rooms we visited already, `target` is the total number of rooms we should visit. 

2. We run dfs on each room's keys and append the key into `visited()`, and compare if `len(visited) == targets`.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        visited = set()
        def dfs(i):
            if i not in visited:
                visited.add(i)
                for key in rooms[i]:
                    dfs(key)
        dfs(0)
        return len(visited) == len(rooms)
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, `n` is the length of rooms. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$
