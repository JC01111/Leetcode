<br>

### Question:
You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the $i^\text{th}$ day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the **same day**.

Find and return _the **maximum** profit you can achieve_.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
> 
> **Output:** 7
>
> **Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4. <br>
> Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3. <br>
> Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** prices = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
> 
> **Output:** 4
>
> **Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4. <br>
> Total profit is 4.

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** prices = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
> 
> **Output:** 0
>
> **Explanation:** There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.

### KeyPoints: 
We just greedily add all the profits by comparing current `prices[i]` with previous `prices[i-1]`, if it is less than the previous price, we can sell it since we can get profits. **Note** that we should start the for loop from `(1, len(prices))`, because we want to compare with `prices[i-1]`.

We can also use similar approach in [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](./121.Best_Time_to_Buy_and_Sell_Stock_(Easy).md), but we need to set `mini = maxi`, buy it back when we sell it at this price, so if a greater price appear, we can still earn it greedily.

<br>

### My Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        # Greedily add all profits
        profit = 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > prices[i-1]:
                profit += (prices[i] - prices[i-1])
        return profit
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

<br>

### Similar to 121:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        # Each price, either update mini or (maxi and profits)
        # Greedy, we can buy it, and a greater one, we can sell, then buy this one back

        # TC: O(n), n=len(prices), SC: O(1)
        mini, maxi = float("inf"), 0
        profits = 0
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            # If less price, we don't buy the previous one
            if prices[i] < mini:
                mini = prices[i]
            else:
                maxi = prices[i]
                profits += maxi - mini
                mini = maxi
        return profits
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
