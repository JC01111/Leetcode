### Question:
You are given an array of strings `products` and a string `searchWord`.

Design a system that suggests at most three product names from `products` after each character of `searchWord` is typed. Suggested products should have common prefix with `searchWord`. If there are more than three products with a common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.

Return _a list of lists of the suggested products after each character of `searchWord` is typed_.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"], searchWord = "mouse"
> 
> **Output:** [["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],["mouse","mousepad"],["mouse","mousepad"],["mouse","mousepad"]]
>
> **Explanation:** products sorted lexicographically = ["mobile","moneypot","monitor","mouse","mousepad"]. After typing m and mo all products match and we show user ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"]. After typing mou, mous and mouse the system suggests ["mouse","mousepad"].

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** products = ["havana"], searchWord = "havana"
> 
> **Output:** [["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"]]
>
> **Explanation:**  The only word "havana" will be always suggested while typing the search word.

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= products.length <= 1000`

* `1 <= products[i].length <= 3000`

* `1 <= sum(products[i].length) <= 2 * 10^4`

* All the strings of `products` are **unique**.

* `products[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

* `1 <= searchWord.length <= 1000`

* `searchWord` consists of lowercase English letters.

### Walk-through: 
1. Same as previous Tries questions, we add all word from `products` into `Trie` with `self.words[], self.n` to save three words at each node with `n`. While `n < 3`, we appending the `sorted(products)` for word we add, then `n += 1`.

2. We use `TrieNode.search()` to return a list or result. It appends each `c` from `searchWord`'s words into `res`.

**Note** we have to `break` in `search()` instead of adding `[]` in the else case, because if we do that, it will append `[]` for the mismatch character, but if they have match character later, they will continue.

### Python Trie Solution:
```python
class TrieNode():
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.words = []   # Words to store all word at node
        self.n = 0
    
    def add(self, word):
        curr = self
        for c in word:
            if c not in curr.children:
                curr.children[c] = TrieNode()
            curr = curr.children[c]
            if curr.n < 3:
                curr.words.append(word)
                curr.n += 1
        
    def search(self, searchWord):
        curr = self
        res = []
        for c in searchWord:
            if c in curr.children:
                curr = curr.children[c]
                res.append(curr.words)
            else:
                break
        while len(res) < len(searchWord):
            res.append([])
        return res

class Solution:
    def suggestedProducts(self, products: List[str], searchWord: str) -> List[List[str]]:
        root = TrieNode()
        products.sort()
        for product in products:
            root.add(product)
        
        return root.search(searchWord)
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(w * l)$, `w` is the number of words, `l` is the length of maximum `word`. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(\text{len(all characters of all words)})$

<br>

### Python Two Pointers Solution:
For two pointers method, we also need to sort `products` first. Then we set `l, r` at the beginning and the end of `products`, and we start looping `searchWord` and check condition if `l, r` are in bound, if current `products[l]` or `products[r]` has index `i`, and if `searchWord[i]` is the same as `products[l][i]` and `products[r][i]`, otherwise, we increment `l` or decrement `r`.

Finally, we first `res.append([])` prevent the case when we have no corresponding product name, and we compare `min(3, remain)` to make sure we append at most `remain` or `3` to `res[-1]`, `res[-1]` will be empty if we have no corresponding product names found.
```python
class Solution:
    def suggestedProducts(self, products: List[str], searchWord: str) -> List[List[str]]:
        products.sort()
        res = []
        l, r = 0, len(products)-1
        for i in range(len(searchWord)):
            while l <= r and (len(products[l]) <= i or products[l][i] != searchWord[i]):
                l += 1
            while l <= r and (len(products[r]) <= i or products[r][i] != searchWord[i]):
                r -= 1
            res.append([])
            remain = r - l + 1
            for j in range(min(3, remain)):
                res[-1].append(products[l + j])
        return res
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(nlog\ n + mlog\ m)$, `n` is the number of words, `m` is the max length of word. Because we perform binary search on `n` and length of word. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
