### Question:
Given 3 positives numbers `a`, `b` and `c`. Return the minimum flips required in some bits of `a` and `b` to make (`a OR `b` == `c`). (bitwise OR operation). <br>
Flip operation consists of change **any** single bit 1 to 0 or change the bit 0 to 1 in their binary representation.

<br>

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** a = 2, b = 6, c = 5
> 
> **Output:** 3
>
> **Explanation:** After flips a = 1 , b = 4 , c = 5 such that (`a` OR `b` == `c`)

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** a = 4, b = 2, c = 7
> 
> **Output:** 1

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
> 
> **Output:** 0

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= a <= 10^9`

* `1 <= b <= 10^9`

* `1 <= c <= 10^9`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
The trick is to notice the pattern when the last bit of `c == 1` and `c == 0`. 

When `c == 1`, we only need to know if there exists at least one `1` in either `a`, `b`, or both `a` and `b`. So we only need to update `res += 1` when `a == 0 and b == 0`, because we need at least one `1`, so we need to flip `1`.

When `c == 0`, we need to know how many `1` in `a` and `b`, because we need to flip `1 -> 0`. We need to flip either `a` or `b` or both `a` and `b` to be `0`.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def minFlips(self, a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:
        # If the last bit of c is 1, we only update res += 1 if both the last bits of a, b are 0
        # If the last bit of c is 0, we update res with how many 1 that a, b have (we need to flip 1 -> 0)
        
        # TC: O(n), n # bits of c, SC: O(1)
        res = 0
        while a or b or c:
            # Last bit of c is 1
            if c & 1 == 1:
                # if a and b are both 0, we need to flip 1 bit
                res += (not a & 1 and not b & 1)
            # Last bit of c is 0
            else:
                # If any of them or both are 1, we add that to res
                res += a & 1
                res += b & 1
            a, b, c = a >> 1, b >> 1, c >> 1

        return res
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, `n` is the bits length of `c`. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
