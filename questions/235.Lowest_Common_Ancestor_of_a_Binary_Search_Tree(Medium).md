### Question:
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

<br>

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
> 
> **Output:** 6
>
> **Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

**Example 2:**

<img src="../images/235_2.png" width=230>

> **Input:** root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
> 
> **Output:** 2
>
> **Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
> 
> **Output:** 2

<br>

#### Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 10^5]`.

* `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`

* All `Node.val` are **unique**.

* `p != q`

* `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.

### KeyPoints: 
The intuitive way to solve is similar to [236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](./236.Lowest_Common_Ancestor_of_a_Binary_Tree(Medium).md), but since this is a **BST** problem, we can use its property to solve it efficiently with $O(log\ n)$ time complexity.

<br>

### My Solution:
This is the same solution of [236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](./236.Lowest_Common_Ancestor_of_a_Binary_Tree(Medium).md), which is slow in Binary Search Tree because BST has the property that `root.left < root < root.right`. So we can just only visit one side of the Tree, which reduces time complexity to $O(log\ n)$.
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        if not root:
            return
        if root == p or root == q:
            return root
        left = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        right = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        if left and right:
            return root
        return left or right
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$

<br>

### Optimized Solution:
Same idea, but since this is a **BST**, we can compare current `root.val` with `p.val` and `q.val` to see if `p, q` are greater than the root.val or less than, then we can update `cur` to its left or right. If, `p, q` are on the two sides of a node, we can just return the node, which is the base case.

Be careful that the question asks to return the LCA node, not value.
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        cur = root
        while cur:
            if p.val > cur.val and q.val > cur.val:
                cur = cur.right
            elif p.val < cur.val and q.val < cur.val:
                cur = cur.left
            else:
                return cur
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(log\ n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
