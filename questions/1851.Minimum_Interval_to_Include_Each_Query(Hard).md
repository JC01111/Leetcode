### Question:
You are given a 2D integer array `intervals`, where `intervals[i] = [left_i, right_i]` describes the `ith` interval starting at `left_i` and ending at `right_i` **(inclusive)**. The **size** of an interval is defined as the number of integers it contains, or more formally `right_i - left_i + 1`.

You are also given an integer array `queries`. The answer to the `jth` query is the **size of the smallest interval** `i` such that `left_i <= queries[j] <= right_i`. If no such interval exists, the answer is `-1`.

Return _an array containing the answers to the queries_.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** intervals = [[1,4],[2,4],[3,6],[4,4]], queries = [2,3,4,5]
> 
> **Output:** [3,3,1,4]
>
> **Explanation:** The queries are processed as follows: <br>
> \- Query = 2: The interval [2,4] is the smallest interval containing 2. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3. <br>
> \- Query = 3: The interval [2,4] is the smallest interval containing 3. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3. <br>
> \- Query = 4: The interval [4,4] is the smallest interval containing 4. The answer is 4 - 4 + 1 = 1. <br>
> \- Query = 5: The interval [3,6] is the smallest interval containing 5. The answer is 6 - 3 + 1 = 4.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** intervals = [[2,3],[2,5],[1,8],[20,25]], queries = [2,19,5,22]
> 
> **Output:** [2,-1,4,6]
>
> **Explanation:** The queries are processed as follows: <br>
> \- Query = 2: The interval [2,3] is the smallest interval containing 2. The answer is 3 - 2 + 1 = 2. <br>
> \- Query = 19: None of the intervals contain 19. The answer is -1. <br>
> \- Query = 5: The interval [2,5] is the smallest interval containing 5. The answer is 5 - 2 + 1 = 4. <br>
> \- Query = 22: The interval [20,25] is the smallest interval containing 22. The answer is 25 - 20 + 1 = 6.

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5`

* `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`

* `intervals[i].length == 2`

* `1 <= left_i <= right_i <= 10^7`

* `1 <= queries[j] <= 10^7`

### Walk-through: 
1. We first sort `intervals` and `queries` and use `res{}` to store the `queries`'s corrsponding minimum interval length. Because we sort them already, we need to use hashmap to return the original order of `queries` later.

2. Loop over `queries` and use a variaible `i` to keep track of current interval we at, we only add intervals to the heap that is within the range of current `query` (`if intervals[i][0] <= query`). We store the interval into `minHeap` with `(length, right of the interval)`.

3. After adding all current related intervals into `minHeap`, we need to check if there is any invalid interval that is **too left** for current `query`, then we pop all invalid intervals (`if minHeap[0][1] < query`). Next, we store the top of `minHeap` into `res[query]` if `minHeap` else `-1`.

4. We can use list comprehension to recover the original order of the queries with the minimum length of interval.

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def minInterval(self, intervals: List[List[int]], queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        intervals.sort()
        res = {}
        minHeap = []
        i = 0
        for query in sorted(queries):
            while i < len(intervals) and intervals[i][0] <= query:
                heapq.heappush(minHeap, (intervals[i][1]-intervals[i][0]+1, intervals[i][1]))
                i += 1
            # Pop invalid intervals from minHeap
            while minHeap and minHeap[0][1] < query:
                heapq.heappop(minHeap)
            res[query] = minHeap[0][0] if minHeap else -1
        return [res[query] for query in queries]
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(nlog\ n + mlog\ m)$, `n` is the length of `intervals`, `m` is the length of `queries`. Because we sort both of them. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, the worst case we store all the intervals into `res{}`.
