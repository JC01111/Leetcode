### Question:
You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return _the number of combinations that make up that amount_. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `0`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

The answer is **guaranteed** to fit into a signed **32-bit** integer.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** amount = 5, coins = [1,2,5]
> 
> **Output:** 4
>
> **Explanation:** there are four ways to make up the amount: <br>
> 5=5 <br>
> 5=2+2+1 <br>
> 5=2+1+1+1 <br>
> 5=1+1+1+1+1

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** amount = 3, coins = [2]
> 
> **Output:** 0
>
> **Explanation:** the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** amount = 10, coins = [10]
> 
> **Output:** 1

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= coins.length <= 300`

* `1 <= coins[i] <= 5000`

* All the values of `coins` are **unique**.

* `0 <= amount <= 5000`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
**2D DP:**
1. We can build a `(amount + 1) * (coins + 1)` dp table, which each `dp[a][c]` indicates the number of ways we can use `c` in coins to achieve `a` in amount. We first initialize `dp[0]` to be all `1`, because the only way for all coins to achieve `0` is not using coins. 

2. We then loop over `(1, amount + 1)`, and visiting the coins backward to fill out the dp table from top to bottom, right to left.

3. Because the last column is the base case, so each time we intialize an entry in dp, we do `dp[a][c] = dp[a][c-1]` to first assign the new entry to be the value of its previous coin, because this new coin should have at least the number of ways of the previous coin to achieve `a`, then we check if `a - coins[c] >= 0`, so we know this new coin `c` can help to achieve `a`, then we add the row `dp[a - coins[c]]`'s number of ways to `dp[a][c]`. 

4. The final value is the last row, first element of the dp table.

```
      1  2  5
0   [[1, 1, 1, 1], 
1   [1, 0, 0, 0], 
2   [2, 1, 0, 0], 
3   [2, 0, 0, 0], 
4   [3, 1, 0, 0], 
5   [4, 1, 1, 0]]


dp[a][i] = dp[a][i-1] + dp[a-1][i]

  5 4 3 2 1 0
1 4 3 2 2 1 1 
2 1 1 0 1 0 1
5 1 0 0 0 0 1
```

<br>

**Optimized 1d DP:**
1. The optimized version we only store the previous column as `prev`, which is initialized to be all `0` and the first row will be `1` for `a = 0`. In the for loop we initialize a new column `dp` to store this column for current coin `c` for each amount `a`.

2. We repeatedly update `prev = dp` from right to left. And return the last element of `dp` as the final result.

### Python DP Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [[0] * (len(coins)+1) for _ in range(amount + 1)]
        dp[0] = [1] * (len(coins)+1)

        for a in range(1, amount+1):
            for c in range(len(coins)-1, -1, -1):
                dp[a][c] = dp[a][c+1]
                if a - coins[c] >= 0:
                    dp[a][c] += dp[a-coins[c]][c]
        return dp[-1][0]
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(m * n)$, `m` is amount, `n` is length of `coins`. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(m * n)$

<br>

### Python Optimized DP Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        prev = [0] * (amount+1)
        prev[0] = 1

        for c in range(len(coins)-1, -1, -1):
            dp = [0] * (amount+1)
            dp[0] = 1   # a = 0 is always 1
            for a in range(1, amount+1):
                dp[a] = prev[a]     # Store previous col
                if a - coins[c] >= 0:
                    dp[a] += dp[a-coins[c]]
            prev = dp
        return dp[amount]
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(m * n)$, `m` is amount, `n` is length of `coins`. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(m)$, since we only store one column.
