## 141. Linked List Cycle (Easy)

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/

<br>

### Question:
Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` if _there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.

<br>

**Example 1:**

<img src="../images/circularlinkedlist.png" alt="drawing" width="370"/>

> **Input:** head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
> 
> **Output:** true
>
> **Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

<br>

**Example 2:**

<img src="../images/circularlinkedlist_test2.png" alt="drawing" width="180"/>

> **Input:** head = [1,2], pos = 0
> 
> **Output:** true
>
> **Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

<br>

**Example 3:**

<img src="../images/circularlinkedlist_test3.png" alt="drawing" width="55"/>

> **Input:** head = [1], pos = -1
> 
> **Output:** false
>
> **Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

<br>

### Confusion: 
I was thinking about a way to check the last node's next and compare if the last node's next is any elements before.

<br>

### KeyPoints: 
Use the Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm (Fast and Slow approach), link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRSItF-Ts4Q.

<br>

### My Solution:
Have to check `fast is slow` not `fast == slow`, because we want those two pointers to be at the same address in memory. By checking that, we know if the Linked List has a cycle, it's guaranteed that no matter how far the slow ptr behind the fast ptr, they will eventually meet.
```python
class Solution(object):
    def hasCycle(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: bool
        """
        fast = head
        slow = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            if fast is slow:
                return True
        return False
```
