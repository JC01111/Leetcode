### Question:
Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths m and n respectively, return _the **minimum window substring** of_ `s` _such that every character in_ `t` (**including duplicates**) _is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string_ `""`.

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
> 
> **Output:** "BANC"
>
> **Explanation:** The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** s = "a", t = "a"
> 
> **Output:** "a"
>
> **Explanation:** The entire string s is the minimum window.

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** s = "a", t = "aa"
> 
> **Output:** ""
>
> **Explanation:** Both 'a's from t must be included in the window. <br>
> Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.

**Edge Case:**
> **Input:** s = "aaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbcdd", t = "abcdd"
> 
> **Output:** "abbbbbcdd"

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `m == s.length`

* `n == t.length`

* `1 <= m, n <= 10^5`

* `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

### KeyPoints: 
We first save `t` into `countT, tMap`, which will be used to compare with `countS, sMap` later. We want to find the minimum window substring when `countS == countT`, and the only condition to update `countS` is either when we add an element in `s` that is in `tMap` and `sMap[s[r]] <= tMap[s[r]]` or when `countS == countT` now we need to move `l` so we decrease `countS`.

While `countS == countT`, we want to increment `l`, and we first decrease the `l`th element by 1 in `sMap` (`sMap[s[l]] -= 1`), then make sure `s[l] in tMap and sMap[s[l]] < tMap[s[l]]` because we may have duplicate `s[l]` in `sMap`, so we have to make sure `sMap[s[l]] < tMap[s[l]]`, when `countS == countT` the elements of `t` in `sMap, tMap` must have same count, so we only need to check `sMap[s[l]] < tMap[s[l]]`.

Finally, we can just return the minimum window substring by `s[res[0], res[1] + 1]`.

### My Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        # Use l, r ptrs in s to maintain a sliding window. Two counts to know when we have a valid substring
        # When sCount = tCount, update res and start shrinking the window
        
        # TC: O(n+m), n = len(s), m = len(t), SC: O(n+m)
        tMap, sMap = {}, {}
        sCount, tCount = 0, len(t)
        res, length = "", float("inf")     # Default length to be s
        # Build tMap
        for c in t:
            tMap[c] = tMap.get(c, 0) + 1
        # Build sMap
        l = 0
        for r in range(len(s)):
            sMap[s[r]] = sMap.get(s[r], 0) + 1
            # We add char first, <= means we have non-duplicate char
            if s[r] in tMap and sMap[s[r]] <= tMap[s[r]]:
                sCount += 1
            # When we have a valid substring
            while sCount == tCount:
                if r-l+1 < length:
                    res = s[l:r+1]
                    length = r-l+1
                sMap[s[l]] -= 1
                # Remove extra chars that appear in tMap won't affect sCount
                # We decrement char first, < means we remove a valid char
                if s[l] in tMap and sMap[s[l]] < tMap[s[l]]:
                    sCount -= 1
                l += 1
        # Check if we have valid substring
        return res if length != float("inf") else ""
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, because we loop over `s, k`. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, because we save two hashmaps for `s, k`.
