<br>

### Question:
There is an `m x n` rectangular island that borders both the **Pacific Ocean** and **Atlantic Ocean**. The **Pacific Ocean** touches the island's left and top edges, and the **Atlantic Ocean** touches the island's right and bottom edges.

The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `heights` where `heights[r][c]` represents the **height above sea level** of the cell at coordinate `(r, c)`.

The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is **less than or equal to** the current cell's height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.

Return _a **2D list** of grid coordinates `result` where `result[i] = [r_i, c_i]` denotes that rain water can flow from cell `(r_i, c_i)` to **both** the Pacific and Atlantic oceans_.

**Example 1:**

<img src="../images/417.jpg" width=400>

> **Input:** heights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]]
> 
> **Output:** [[0,4],[1,3],[1,4],[2,2],[3,0],[3,1],[4,0]]
>
> **Explanation:** The following cells can flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as shown below:
```
[0,4]: [0,4] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [0,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[1,3]: [1,3] -> [0,3] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [1,3] -> [1,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[1,4]: [1,4] -> [1,3] -> [0,3] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [1,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[2,2]: [2,2] -> [1,2] -> [0,2] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [2,2] -> [2,3] -> [2,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[3,0]: [3,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [3,0] -> [4,0] -> Atlantic Ocean
[3,1]: [3,1] -> [3,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [3,1] -> [4,1] -> Atlantic Ocean
[4,0]: [4,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [4,0] -> Atlantic Ocean
Note that there are other possible paths for these cells to flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
```

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** heights = [[1]]
> 
> **Output:** [[0,0]]
>
> **Explanation:** The water can flow from the only cell to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

#### Constraints:
* `m == heights.length`

* `n == heights[r].length`

* `1 <= m, n <= 200`

* `0 <= heights[r][c] <= 10^5`

### Walk-through: 
This type of question is simlar to [130. Surrounded Regions](./questions/130.Surrounded_Regions(Medium).md). We can reverse thinking by starting finding the grids that can receive water from edges, and we run **DFS** from the edges and store these grids that can touch either pacific ocan or atlantic ocean to their `set()`. And we finally find these grids are in both `pac()` and `atl()` append to `res[]`.

1. Start searching from broader of Pac Ocean and Atl Ocean.

2. Run DFS from edges, if a grid is greater or equal to prevHeight, we add to visit

3. Find common grid in both sets to append to res[]

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def pacificAtlantic(self, heights: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        rows, cols = len(heights), len(heights[0])
        pac, atl = set(), set()
        res = []
        def dfs(r, c, visit, preHeight):
            if r not in range(rows) or c not in range(cols) or heights[r][c] < preHeight or (r, c) in visit:
                return
            visit.add((r, c))
            dfs(r+1, c, visit, heights[r][c])
            dfs(r-1, c, visit, heights[r][c])
            dfs(r, c+1, visit, heights[r][c])
            dfs(r, c-1, visit, heights[r][c])

        # Checking first and last row of heights
        for c in range(cols):
            dfs(0, c, pac, heights[0][c])
            dfs(rows-1, c, atl, heights[rows-1][c])

        # Checking first and last col of heights
        for r in range(rows):
            dfs(r, 0, pac, heights[r][0])
            dfs(r, cols-1, atl, heights[r][cols-1])
        
        # Appending (r, c) in both sets
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if (r, c) in pac and (r, c) in atl:
                    res.append([r, c])
        return res
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(m * n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(m * n)$

        List<List<Integer>> res = new ArrayList<>();
        int rows = heights.length;
        int cols = heights[0].length;
        for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
            dfs(r, 0, heights[r][0], heights, pac);
            dfs(r, cols-1, heights[r][cols-1], heights, atl);

                if (pac.contains(r + "," + c) && atl.contains(r + "," + c)) {
                    res.add(Arrays.asList(r, c));
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
    private void dfs(int r, int c, int prevHeight, int[][] heights, Set<String> visit) {
        int rows = heights.length;
        int cols = heights[0].length;
        if (r < 0 || r >= rows || c < 0 || c >= cols || heights[r][c] < prevHeight || visit.contains(r + "," + c)) {
            return;
        }
        visit.add(r + "," + c);
        dfs(r+1, c, heights[r][c], heights, visit);
        dfs(r-1, c, heights[r][c], heights, visit);
        dfs(r, c+1, heights[r][c], heights, visit);
        dfs(r, c-1, heights[r][c], heights, visit);
    }
