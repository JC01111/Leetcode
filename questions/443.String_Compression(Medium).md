### Question:
Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:

Begin with an empty string `s`. For each group of **consecutive repeating characters** in `chars`:

* If the group's length is `1`, append the character to `s`.

* Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

The compressed string `s` **should not be returned separately**, but instead, be stored **in the input character array** `chars`. Note that group lengths that are `10` or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.

After you are done **modifying the input array**, return _the new length of the array_.

You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
> 
> **Output:** Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
>
> **Explanation:** The groups are "aa", "bb", and "ccc". This compresses to "a2b2c3".

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** chars = ["a"]
> 
> **Output:** Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: ["a"]
>
> **Explanation:** The only group is "a", which remains uncompressed since it's a single character.

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** chars = ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
> 
> **Output:** Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].
>
> **Explanation:** The groups are "a" and "bbbbbbbbbbbb". This compresses to "ab12".

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= chars.length <= 2000`

* `chars[i]` is a lowercase English letter, uppercase English letter, digit, or symbol.

### Walk-through: 
Initialize `i, place` to keep track of each element's start index, and we use `place` to update `chars` with each char with their counts. We check if `count > 1` we append each `c in str(counts)` into `chars`, e.g. `counts = 12`, we append `"1", "2"`. Finally, we return `place` since it represents the new length.

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def compress(self, chars: List[str]) -> int:
        i = 0
        place = 0
        while i < len(chars):
            count = 0
            letter = chars[i]
            # Update i and count
            while i < len(chars) and chars[i] == letter:
                i += 1
                count += 1
            # Update chars
            chars[place] = letter
            place += 1
            # Check if count > 1 and append with val
            if count > 1:
                for c in str(count):
                    chars[place] = c
                    place += 1
        return place
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
