### Question:
There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that you **must** take course `b_i` first if you want to take course `a_i`.

* For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return _the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses_. If there are many valid answers, return **any** of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return **an empty array**.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
> 
> **Output:** [0,1]
>
> **Explanation:** There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
> 
> **Output:** [0,2,1,3]
>
> **Explanation:** There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0. <br>
> So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].

**Example 3:**
> **Input:**  numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
> 
> **Output:** [0]

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`

* `0 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 1)`

* `prerequisites[i].length == 2`

* `0 <= a_i, b_i < numCourses`

* `a_i != b_i`

* All the pairs `[a_i, b_i]` are **distinct**.

<br>

### Walk-through: 
1. We need to build "graph", which to add all the prereqs of a course into dictionary, `prereq = {course: [prerequisites]}`.

2. Run DFS to detect loop with `cycle(), visited()`, `cycle` is a temporary set to save courses from one course to all its prerequisites. So, we check the base case `if node in cycle: return False`, which means we have a loop in current course's prerequisites. `if node in visited`, we should return True, because we know this prereq can be finished. 

3. We run DFS to check each course can be finished or not, `if not dfs(crs)`, we should return `[]`.

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def findOrder(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        # 1. Build prereq: {0: [], 1: [0], 2: [0], 3: [1, 2]}
        # 2. Run DFS on numCourses-1 with visited() and cycle(), check all prereq of current course.
        # If a crs in cycle: return False. If a crs in visited(): return True, then remove crs from cycle. Run cycle for a list of prerequistes.

        # TC: O(V+E), n = numCourses, SC: O(V)
        prereq = collections.defaultdict(list)      # {course: [prereq]}
        # Add prereq for each course
        for crs, pre in prerequisites:
            prereq[crs].append(pre)
        # Find the courses we need to take in order and detect loop
        cycle, visited = set(), set()
        ans = []    # order to take courses
        def dfs(node):
            if node in cycle:
                return False
            if node in visited:
                return True
            cycle.add(node)
            # Explore prereqs for current node
            for pre in prereq[node]:
                if not dfs(pre):
                    return False
            cycle.remove(node)
            visited.add(node)
            ans.append(node)
            return True
        # Check for every course, make sure no loop
        for crs in range(numCourses):
            # If there is a loop, return []
            if not dfs(crs):
                return []
        return ans
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(V + E)$, we are checking edges and vertices. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(V + E)$, `preMap{}` is storing all edges and vertices.
