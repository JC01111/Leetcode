### Question:
There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that you **must** take course `b_i` first if you want to take course `a_i`.

* For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return _the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses_. If there are many valid answers, return **any** of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return **an empty array**.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
> 
> **Output:** [0,1]
>
> **Explanation:** There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
> 
> **Output:** [0,2,1,3]
>
> **Explanation:** There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0. <br>
> So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].

**Example 3:**
> **Input:**  numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
> 
> **Output:** [0]

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`

* `0 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 1)`

* `prerequisites[i].length == 2`

* `0 <= a_i, b_i < numCourses`

* `a_i != b_i`

* All the pairs `[a_i, b_i]` are **distinct**.

### Walk-through: 
1. Similar to [207. Course Schedule](./questions/207.Course_Schedule_(Medium).md), we first map every prerequisites of course into `preMap{}`. And we just run Topological sort and DFS on each node to check if there is any cycle.

2. We run **DFS** on all `course`'s prerequisites to check whether there is cycle by adding `course` into `visited()` and `cycle()`, so if `course in cycle()`, we `return False` because there can't be repeated `course` in the same cycle we are visiting right now. But, it is ok to have `course in visited()`.

3. If we check all `course`'s prerequisites have no cycle, we can remove `course` from `cycle()` and add `course` into `visited()` and append to `res[]`. And return `True` in the end, because the last for loop is looping over `course in range(numCourses)` to check if `not dfs(course)`, we return `[]`.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def findOrder(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        preMap = {i: [] for i in range(numCourses)}
        res = []
        visited, cycle = set(), set()
        for course, pre in prerequisites:
            preMap[course].append(pre)

        def dfs(course):
            if course in cycle:
                return False
            if course in visited:
                return True
            cycle.add(course)
            for pre in preMap[course]:
                if not dfs(pre):
                    return False
            cycle.remove(course)
            visited.add(course)
            res.append(course)
            return True

        for course in range(numCourses):
            if not dfs(course):
                return []
        return res
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(V + E)$, we are checking edges and vertices. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(V + E)$, `preMap{}` is storing all edges and vertices.
