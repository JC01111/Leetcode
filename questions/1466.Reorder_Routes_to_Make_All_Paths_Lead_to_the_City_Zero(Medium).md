### Question:
There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and `n - 1` roads such that there is only one way to travel between two different cities (this network form a tree). Last year, The ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction because they are too narrow.

Roads are represented by `connections` where `connections[i] = [a_i, b_i]` represents a road from city `a_i` to city `b_i`.

This year, there will be a big event in the capital (city `0`), and many people want to travel to this city.

Your task consists of reorienting some roads such that each city can visit the city `0`. Return the **minimum** number of edges changed.

It's **guaranteed** that each city can reach city `0` after reorder.

<br>

**Example 1:**

<img src="../images/1466_1.png" width=350>

> **Input:** n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[1,3],[2,3],[4,0],[4,5]]
> 
> **Output:** 3
>
> **Explanation:** Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).

**Example 2:**

<img src="../images/1466_2.png" width=350>

> **Input:** n = 5, connections = [[1,0],[1,2],[3,2],[3,4]]
> 
> **Output:** 2
>
> **Explanation:** Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** n = 3, connections = [[1,0],[2,0]]
> 
> **Output:** 0

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`

* `connections.length == n - 1`

* `connections[i].length == 2`

* `0 <= a_i, b_i <= n - 1`

* `a_i != b_i`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
1. Save all the current adges from `connections`. Use a dictionary `neighbors` to store all `a, b` from `connections`, because we want to save all node's neighbors into a list. Also, we need to have a `visited()` set to keep track of cities we visited.

2. We run **dfs** on all neighbors from `neighbor[city]`, we check if `(neighbor, city)` is in `edges` or not. <br> Look at the base case, we start checking if city 0's neighbors can reach city 0 by checking `(0's neighbor, 0)`, then we run dfs on 0's neighbor. <br> We want to see if that neighbor's neighbor have a valid edge to 0's neighbor `(0's neighbor's neighbor, 0'neighbor)`. If we don't have a valid edge exist for current `(neighbor, city)`, we will increment `res`.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def minReorder(self, n: int, connections: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        visited = set()
        res = 0
        edges = {(a, b) for a, b in connections}
        neighbors = collections.defaultdict(list)

        for a, b in connections:
            neighbors[a].append(b)
            neighbors[b].append(a)

        def dfs(city):
            nonlocal edges, neighbors, visited, res
            for neighbor in neighbors[city]:
                if neighbor in visited:
                    continue
                if (neighbor, city) not in edges:
                    res += 1
                visited.add(neighbor)
                dfs(neighbor)
                
        visited.add(0)
        dfs(0)
        return res
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, `n` is the length of `connections` <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$
