### Question:
You are given an `n x n` integer matrix board where the cells are labeled from `1` to `n^2` in a Boustrophedon style starting from the bottom left of the board (i.e. `board[n - 1][0]`) and alternating direction each row.

You start on square `1` of the board. In each move, starting from square `curr`, do the following:

* Choose a destination square `next` with a label in the range `[curr + 1, min(curr + 6, n^2)]`.
    * This choice simulates the result of a standard **6-sided die roll**: i.e., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board.

* If `next` has a snake or ladder, you **must** move to the destination of that snake or ladder. Otherwise, you move to `next`.

* The game ends when you reach the square `n^2`.

A board square on row `r` and column `c` has a snake or ladder if `board[r][c] != -1`. The destination of that snake or ladder is `board[r][c]`. Squares `1` and `n^2` are not the starting points of any snake or ladder.

Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move. If the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do **not** follow the subsequent snake or ladder.

* For example, suppose the board is `[[-1,4],[-1,3]]`, and on the first move, your destination square is `2`. You follow the ladder to square `3`, but do not follow the subsequent ladder to `4`.

Return _the least number of moves required to reach the square_ `n^2`. _If it is not possible to reach the square, return_ `-1`.

<br>

**Example 1:**

<img src="../images/909.png" width=500>

> **Input:** board = [[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,35,-1,-1,13,-1],[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-1,15,-1,-1,-1,-1]]
> 
> **Output:** 4
>
> **Explanation:** <br>
> In the beginning, you start at square 1 (at row 5, column 0). <br>
> You decide to move to square 2 and must take the ladder to square 15. <br>
> You then decide to move to square 17 and must take the snake to square 13. <br>
> You then decide to move to square 14 and must take the ladder to square 35. <br>
> You then decide to move to square 36, ending the game. <br>
> This is the lowest possible number of moves to reach the last square, so return 4.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** board = [[-1,-1],[-1,3]]
> 
> **Output:** 1

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `n == board.length == board[i].length`

* `2 <= n <= 20`

* `board[i][j]` is either `-1`or in the range `[1, n^2]`.

* The squares labeled `1` and `n^2` are not the starting points of any snake or ladder.

### Walk-through: 
1. First, understand this question, we want to find how many moves we need to reach $n^2$ (`n` is the length of `board`) from `1`. So we can think about using **BFS** to store all entries we can reach for each move into a `deque[]`. Then, we return `moves + 1` if we find a square + a value from `range(1, 7)` equals to $n^2$.

2. Run **BFS** from `deque([1, 0])` because the first entry of the board is always `1` with `0` move. Then we save `nextSquare = square + i` (because we take the jump of ladder or snake) where `i in range(1, 7)` with `moves + 1`, so we append `[nextSquare, moves + 1]` into `deque`.

3. The next challenge is the `findPos` function. Based on the entry we can reach for current move, we want to find the position on board, so we can get the value of this entry. <br> So, based on the `square` we are given, we can use this number to find `r, c`, e.g. `6` will have `r = 6 - 1 // n`, `c = 6-1 % n`. We need to be careful of the case when `r` is odd, we need to reverse the `c` we find by `n-1-c`. Then, we return the position `[r, c]`.

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def snakesAndLadders(self, board: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(board)
        board.reverse()

        def findPos(square):
            r = (square - 1) // n
            c = (square - 1) % n
            # Reverse odd row's column
            if r % 2:
                c = n - 1 - c
            return [r, c]

        deque = collections.deque()
        deque.append([1, 0])
        visited = set()
        visited.add(1)
        while deque:
            square, moves = deque.popleft()
            for i in range(1, 7):
                nextSquare = square + i
                r, c = findPos(nextSquare)
                if board[r][c] != -1:
                    nextSquare = board[r][c]
                if nextSquare == n * n:
                    return moves + 1
                if nextSquare not in visited:
                    visited.add(nextSquare)
                    deque.append([nextSquare, moves + 1])
        return -1
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, loop over all entries in the worst case. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$, we need to add the whole board into set() in the worst case.
