### Question:
A **permutation** of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

* For example, for `arr = [1,2,3]`, the following are all the permutations of `arr`: `[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]`.

The **next permutation** of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the **next permutation** of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

* For example, the next permutation of `arr = [1,2,3]` is `[1,3,2]`.

* Similarly, the next permutation of `arr = [2,3,1]` is `[3,1,2]`.

* While the next permutation of `arr = [3,2,1]` is `[1,2,3]` because `[3,2,1]` does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers `nums`, find the next permutation of `nums`.

The replacement must be **in place** and use only constant extra memory.

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** nums = [1,2,3]
> 
> **Output:** [1,3,2]

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** nums = [3,2,1]
> 
> **Output:** [1,2,3]

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** nums = [1,1,5]
> 
> **Output:** [1,5,1]

**Edge Case:**
> **Input:** nums = [1,5,8,4,7,6,5,3,1]
> 
> **Output:** [1,5,8,5,1,3,4,6,7]

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= nums.length <= 100`

* `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`

### Walk-through: 
Notice the pattern that if `nums` is decending, then we don't have next permutation, we have to traverse the whole `nums`.

From the right to left of `nums`, the elements are decending, so if we find an element such that `nums[i] < nums[i+1]`, then we can find another element such that `nums[j] > nums[i]` (if `i >= 0`), because these two elements will be the smallest digits to swap, so we swap them to form the **next permutation**.

Finally, we need to reverse `nums[i+1:]` to make them to be the smallest, since the right part of `nums[i:]` is decreasing. And also, we check `if i >= 0` so even when `i = -1`, we can swap the whole `nums` to be ascending.

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def nextPermutation(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        # Find an element such that `nums[i] < nums[i+1]`, find another element such that `nums[j] > nums[i]`, swap them, then reverse `nums[i+1:]`

        # TC: O(n), n=len(nums), SC: O(1)
        i, j = len(nums)-2, len(nums)-1
        # Find elememt that nums[i] < nums[i+1]
        while i >= 0 and nums[i] >= nums[i+1]:
            i -= 1
        # Check if nums has next permutation
        if i >= 0:
            while j >= 0 and nums[j] <= nums[i]:
                j -= 1
            # Swap two elements
            nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
        # Reverse
        nums[i+1:] = nums[i+1:][::-1]
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
