### Question:
Given two strings `ransomNote` and `magazine`, return `true` if `ransomNote` can be constructed by using the letters from `magazine` and `false` otherwise.

Each letter in `magazine` can only be used once in `ransomNote`.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** ransomNote = "a", magazine = "b"
> 
> **Output:** false

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "ab"
> 
> **Output:** false

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"
> 
> **Output:** true

<br>

### My Solution:
We use `set()` here to keep track of each char in magazine and the repeated times of that char. Then we check if the char in `ransomNote` is in the `letter` or not, if not, that means we have not enough char in `magazine` to construct `ransomNote`. To delete `key` in `set()`, using `del letter[i]`.
```python
class Solution:
    def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:
        letter = {}
        for j in magazine:
            if j not in letter:
                letter[j] = 1
            else:
                letter[j] += 1
        
        for i in ransomNote:
            if i not in letter:
                return False
            if letter[i] == 1:
                del letter[i]
            if i in letter:
                letter[i] -= 1
        return True
```
