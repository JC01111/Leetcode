### Question:
Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return the number of islands.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** grid = [ <br>
  ["1","1","1","1","0"], <br>
  ["1","1","0","1","0"], <br>
  ["1","1","0","0","0"], <br>
  ["0","0","0","0","0"] <br>
]
> 
> **Output:** 1

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** grid = [ <br>
  ["1","1","0","0","0"], <br>
  ["1","1","0","0","0"], <br>
  ["0","0","1","0","0"], <br>
  ["0","0","0","1","1"] <br>
]
> 
> **Output:** 3

### KeyPoints: 
Perform BFS, 'cache' all the neighboring grids, if found not in the cache, islands += 1

### My Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        visited = set()
        islands = 0
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])

        def bfs(r, c):
            deque = collections.deque()
            deque.append((r, c))
            visited.add((r, c))  # now they are visited
            while deque:
                row, col = deque.pop()
                directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, -1], [0, 1]]  # N,S,W,E
                for dr, dc in directions:
                    r, c = row + dr, col + dc
                    # Check if four directions of current position are valid
                    if r in range(rows) and c in range(cols) and grid[r][c] == '1' and (r, c) not in visited:
                        deque.append((r, c))
                        visited.add((r, c))
        # Perform BFS, 'cache' all the neighboring grids, if found not in the cache, islands += 1
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == '1' and (r, c) not in visited:
                    bfs(r, c)
                    islands += 1
        return islands
```
