### Question:
Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return the number of islands.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** grid = [ <br>
  ["1","1","1","1","0"], <br>
  ["1","1","0","1","0"], <br>
  ["1","1","0","0","0"], <br>
  ["0","0","0","0","0"] <br>
]
> 
> **Output:** 1

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** grid = [ <br>
  ["1","1","0","0","0"], <br>
  ["1","1","0","0","0"], <br>
  ["0","0","1","0","0"], <br>
  ["0","0","0","1","1"] <br>
]
> 
> **Output:** 3

<br>

### Walk-through: 
Loop over all the grids in the board to check if each grid is in `visited()` or not, if not and `grid[r][c] == 1` we can cache all its neighbors by **BFS** starting from this grid and increment `islands` by `'1'` ('1' is string), because this continent of island has not been visited before.

<br>

### DFS Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        # Run DFS from an entry = 1, mark all the connected island in visited(), each time we have a new entry = 1, increment cnts
        
        # TC: O(m*n), SC: O(m*n)
        visited = set()
        ans = 0
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        directions = [[-1, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]]
        # Run DFS to mark all entries in one island to be visited
        def dfs(r, c):
            visited.add((r, c))
            for dr, dc in directions:
                row, col = r+dr, c+dc
                if row in range(rows) and col in range(cols) and (row, col) not in visited and grid[row][col] == '1':
                    dfs(row, col)
        # Find islands
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if (r, c) not in visited and grid[r][c] == '1':
                    ans += 1
                    dfs(r, c)
        return ans
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(m * n)$, we are checking each grid in `grid`. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(m * n)$, we need to store all `grid` in `visited`.

### BFS Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        visited = set()
        islands = 0
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])

        def bfs(r, c):
            deque = collections.deque()
            deque.append((r, c))
            visited.add((r, c))  # now they are visited
            while deque:
                row, col = deque.pop()
                directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, -1], [0, 1]]  # N,S,W,E
                for dr, dc in directions:
                    r, c = row + dr, col + dc
                    # Check if four directions of current position are valid
                    if r in range(rows) and c in range(cols) and grid[r][c] == '1' and (r, c) not in visited:
                        deque.append((r, c))
                        visited.add((r, c))
        # Perform BFS, 'cache' all the neighboring grids, if found not in the cache, islands += 1
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == '1' and (r, c) not in visited:
                    bfs(r, c)
                    islands += 1
        return islands
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(m * n)$, we are checking each grid in `grid`. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(m * n)$, we need to store all `grid` in `visited`.

### C++ Solution:
1. C++ uses `{}` as `[]` in Python.

2. `const auto& [r, c]: directions` to unpack row and col from `directions` as `r, c`.

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    set<pair<int, int>> visited;
    vector<pair<int, int>> directions = {{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}};

public:
    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        // Run DFS on each entry with a visited() to store all the entries of the island
        int cnts = 0;
        int rows = grid.size();
        int cols = grid[0].size();
        // Find number of islands
        for (int r=0; r < rows; r++) {
            for (int c=0; c < cols; c++) {
                if (grid[r][c] == '1' && !visited.contains({r, c})) {
                    cnts++;
                    dfs(r, c, grid);
                }
            }
        }
        return cnts;
    }

    // Run DFS to mark all entries in an island to be visited
    void dfs(int r, int c, vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        visited.insert({r, c});
        int rows = grid.size();
        int cols = grid[0].size();
        for (const auto& [dr, dc]: directions) {
            int row = r + dr;
            int col = c + dc;
            // Check if neighbors are valid to visit
            if (row >= 0 && row < rows && col >= 0 && col < cols && grid[row][col] == '1' && !visited.contains({row, col})) {
                dfs(row, col, grid);
            }
        }
    }
};
```
