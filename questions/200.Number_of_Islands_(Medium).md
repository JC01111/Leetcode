### Question:
Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return the number of islands.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** grid = [ <br>
  ["1","1","1","1","0"], <br>
  ["1","1","0","1","0"], <br>
  ["1","1","0","0","0"], <br>
  ["0","0","0","0","0"] <br>
]
> 
> **Output:** 1

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** grid = [ <br>
  ["1","1","0","0","0"], <br>
  ["1","1","0","0","0"], <br>
  ["0","0","1","0","0"], <br>
  ["0","0","0","1","1"] <br>
]
> 
> **Output:** 3

<br>

### Walk-through: 
Loop over all the grids in the board to check if each grid is in `visited()` or not, if not and `grid[r][c] == 1` we can cache all its neighbors by **BFS** starting from this grid and increment `islands` by `1`, because this continent of island has not been visited before.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        visited = set()
        islands = 0
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])

        def bfs(r, c):
            deque = collections.deque()
            deque.append((r, c))
            visited.add((r, c))  # now they are visited
            while deque:
                row, col = deque.pop()
                directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, -1], [0, 1]]  # N,S,W,E
                for dr, dc in directions:
                    r, c = row + dr, col + dc
                    # Check if four directions of current position are valid
                    if r in range(rows) and c in range(cols) and grid[r][c] == '1' and (r, c) not in visited:
                        deque.append((r, c))
                        visited.add((r, c))
        # Perform BFS, 'cache' all the neighboring grids, if found not in the cache, islands += 1
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == '1' and (r, c) not in visited:
                    bfs(r, c)
                    islands += 1
        return islands
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(m * n)$, we are checking each grid in `grid`. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(m * n)$, we need to store all `grid` in `visited`.

### Python Recursion Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        # We loop over the grid
        # For each grid we run BFS, if current entry is not in visited, means we find a new island, so we add all its neighbors into visited()

        # TC: O(m * n), SC: O(m * n)
        visited = set()
        res = 0
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        def bfs(row, col):
            directions = [[-1, 0], [1, 0], [0, -1], [0, 1]]
            for dr, dc in directions:
                r, c = row + dr, col + dc
                if r in range(rows) and c in range(cols) and (r, c) not in visited and grid[r][c] == '1':
                    visited.add((r, c))
                    bfs(r, c)
        
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == '1' and (r, c) not in visited:
                    res += 1
                    bfs(r, c)
        
        return res
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(m * n)$, we are checking each grid in `grid`. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(m * n)$, we need to store all `grid` in `visited`.

### C++ Solution:
1. C++ uses `{}` as `[]` in Python.

2. `auto [r, c] = q.front()` to get the `r, c` in `q`.

3. `const auto& [r, c]: directions` to unpack row and col from `directions` as `r, c`.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        set<pair<int, int>> visited;
        queue<pair<int, int>> q;
        int islands = 0;
        int rows = grid.size();
        int cols = grid[0].size();
        for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
                if (grid[r][c] == '1' && visited.count({r, c}) == 0) {
                    bfs(grid, r, c, rows, cols, visited, q);
                    islands++;
                }
            }
        }
        return islands;
    }

private:
    void bfs(vector<vector<char>>& grid, int row, int col, int rows, int cols, set<pair<int, int>>& visited, queue<pair<int, int>>& q) {
        visited.insert({row, col});
        q.push({row, col});
        vector<pair<int, int>> directions = {{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};
        while (!q.empty()) {
            auto [r, c] = q.front();
            q.pop();
            for (const auto& [dr, dc]: directions) {
                int nr = dr + r;
                int nc = dc + c;
                if (nr >= 0 && nr < rows && nc >= 0 && nc < cols && grid[nr][nc] == '1' && visited.count({nr, nc}) == 0) {
                    visited.insert({nr, nc});
                    q.push({nr, nc});
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
```
