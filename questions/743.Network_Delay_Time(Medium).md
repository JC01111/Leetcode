### Question:
You are given a network of `n` nodes, labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given `times`, a list of travel times as directed edges `times[i] = (u_i, v_i, w_i)`, where `u_i` is the source node, `v_i` is the target node, and `w_i` is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

We will send a signal from a given node `k`. Return the **minimum** time it takes for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal, return `-1`.

<br>

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2
> 
> **Output:** 2

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 1
> 
> **Output:** 1

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 2
> 
> **Output:** -1

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= k <= n <= 100`

* `1 <= times.length <= 6000`

* `times[i].length == 3`

* `1 <= ui, vi <= n`

* `ui != vi`

* `0 <= wi <= 100`

* All the pairs `(ui, vi)` are **unique**. (i.e., no multiple edges.)

<br>

### Walk-through: 
1. Run Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path from `k` to `n`. We use `minHeap` to implement this.

2. Store all src's target into `edges` with their weight, we can use them later.

3. Store current node's neighbors and their weights into `minHeap`. And for each time, we update the `res = max(res, weight)`, and then we append this node's neighbors and weights into `minHeap`.

4. Finally, we return `res` if `len(visited) == n`, that means we traverse all the nodes, otherwise, we should return `-1`.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def networkDelayTime(self, times: List[List[int]], n: int, k: int) -> int:
        # Dijkstra's algorithm, maintain a minHeap [weight, node]
        # From k to all n nodes
        edges = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for u, v, w in times:
            edges[u].append((w, v))
        
        minHeap, visited = [(0, k)], set()
        res = 0
        while minHeap:
            w1, n1 = heapq.heappop(minHeap)
            if n1 not in visited:
                visited.add(n1)
                res = max(res, w1)
                # Append n1's neighbors into minHeap
                for w2, n2 in edges[n1]:
                    if n2 not in visited:
                        heapq.heappush(minHeap, (w1+w2, n2))

        return res if len(visited) == n else -1
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(E * log\ V)$, `E` is total edges, `V` is total vertices. Because when we explore a new edge, we need to push a new node in minHeap, which takes $O(logV)$. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(V)$
