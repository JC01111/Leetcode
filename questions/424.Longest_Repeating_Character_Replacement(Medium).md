<br>

### Question:
You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most `k` times.

Return _the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations_.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** s = "ABAB", k = 2
> 
> **Output:** 4
>
> **Explanation:** Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** s = "AABABBA", k = 1
> 
> **Output:** 4
>
> **Explanation:** Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA". <br>
> The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4. <br>
> There may exists other ways to achieve this answer too.

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`

* `s` consists of only uppercase English letters.

* `0 <= k <= s.length`

<br>

### KeyPoints: 
Using sliding window technique, we have `l, r` pointers to keep track of a range of elements in `s`, we use `hashmap` to keep track of the counts of each element and we update the `hashmap` when we have enough `k` to subtract for the most counts element or we move the `l` pointer when we don't have enough `k` for `(r - l + 1) - k`. 

`(r - l + 1) - k` is to check for current range of elements, if the most repeated element can replace other elements with `k` times and make it to be the most repeated element, if not, we need to use while loop to increment `l` to fix the size of current range have enough `k` times of operations for that element.

### Refined Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        hashmap = {}
        l = 0
        for r in range(len(s)):
            hashmap[s[r]] = 1 + hashmap.get(s[r], 0)
            while (r - l + 1) - max(hashmap.values()) > k:
                hashmap[s[l]] -= 1
                l += 1
            res = max((r - l + 1), res)
        return res
```

<br>

### My Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        # Use Hashmap to record a range of each element counts
        # If len(range) - most_frequent_counts > k, l += 1
        # Otherwise, r += 1, res = max(res, r - l + 1)
        res = 0
        hashmap = {}
        l, r = 0, 0
        while r < len(s):
            if s[r] in hashmap:
                hashmap[s[r]] += 1
            else:
                hashmap[s[r]] = 1
            while (r - l + 1) - max(hashmap.values()) > k:
                hashmap[s[l]] -= 1
                l += 1
            res = max((r - l + 1), res)
            r += 1
        return res
```
