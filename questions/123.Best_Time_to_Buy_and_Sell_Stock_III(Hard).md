<br>

### Question:
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete **at most two transactions**.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
> 
> **Output:** 6
>
> **Explanation:** Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3. <br>
> Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
> 
> **Output:** 4
>
> **Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4. <br>
> Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
> 
> **Output:** 0
>
> **Explanation:** In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

**Edge Case:**
> **Input:** prices = [3,5,2,5]
> 
> **Output:** 5

**Edge Case:**
> **Input:** prices = [4,6,4,5]
> 
> **Output:** 3

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`

* `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^5`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
**DP:** <br>
Build 2 dp for `i`th price's left maximum profit and right maximum profit at index `i`. Because, we can't engage in multiple transactions simultaneously, the recurrence relation is `left_profits[i] + right_profits[i+1]` for the total maximum profits we can get at in dex `i` by doing two transactions.

**Space Optimization:** <br>
We can keep track of the cost and profit for each transaction, we always want to find the min for cost, max for profit. So for the first transaction, we want to find the minimum price from `prices` as cost, the profit will just be current `i`th price - cost (min cost so far).

Updating the second transaction's cost and profit at the same time. The cost for the 2nd transaction is `(curr_price - 1stXact_profit)`, the profit is `curr_price - cost of 2nd Xact`.

<br>

### DP Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        # Build dp for maximum profits we can get from the left of ith price. Also dp for maximum profits we can get from the right of ith price.
        # Recurrence Relation: ans = max(ans, left_profts[i] + right_profits[i+1]), because only one transaction per price

        # TC: O(n), n=len(prices), SC: O(n)
        left_profits = [0] * len(prices)
        right_profits = [0] * (len(prices)+1)    # off by 1 for the right
        left_min, right_max = prices[0], prices[-1]
        ans = 0
        # Fill out dp
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            j = len(prices)-i-1
            # Fill out left_profits
            if prices[i] < left_min:
                left_min = prices[i]
            # Update dp[i] with dp[i-1] or prices[i] - curr_min
            left_profits[i] = max(left_profits[i-1], prices[i] - left_min)
            # Fill out right_profits
            if prices[j] > right_max:
                right_max = prices[j]
            # Update dp[j] with either right neighbor or curr_max - prices[i]
            right_profits[j] = max(right_profits[j+1], right_max - prices[j])
        
        # Update ans
        for i in range(len(left_profits)):
            ans = max(ans, left_profits[i] + right_profits[i+1])
        return ans
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$

### Optimization for Space Complexity:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        # Use variables for buy, sell to keep track of the cost and profits of a transaction, update the minimum for cost, maximum for profit
        # Cost for 1st Xact: min_price
        # Profit for 1st Xact: ith_price - cost
        # Cost for 2nd Xact: buying ith price - profit from 1st transaction
        # Profit for 2nd Xact: selling ith price - cost for 2nd Xact

        # TC: O(n), n=len(prices), SC: O(1)
        c1, p1 = float("inf"), 0    # cost and profit
        c2, p2 = float("inf"), 0
        for p in prices:
            c1 = min(c1, p)
            p1 = max(p1, p-c1)
            c2 = min(c2, p-p1)
            p2 = max(p2, p-c2)
        # Second Xact's profit is final total profits
        return p2
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
