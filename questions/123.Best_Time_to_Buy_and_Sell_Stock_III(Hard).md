### Question:
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete **at most two transactions**.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
> 
> **Output:** 6
>
> **Explanation:** Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3. <br>
> Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
> 
> **Output:** 4
>
> **Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4. <br>
> Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
> 
> **Output:** 0
>
> **Explanation:** In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`

* `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^5`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
Build 2 dp for `i`th price's left maximum profit and right maximum profit at index `i`. Because, we can't engage in multiple transactions simultaneously, the recurrence relation is `left_profits[i] + right_profits[i+1]` for the total maximum profits we can get at in dex `i` by doing two transactions.

<br>

### DP Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        # Build dp for maximum profits we can get from the left of ith price. Also dp for maximum profits we can get from the right of ith price.
        # Recurrence Relation: ans = max(ans, left_profts[i] + right_profits[i+1]), because only one transaction per price

        # TC: O(n), n=len(prices), SC: O(n)
        left_profits = [0] * len(prices)
        right_profits = [0] * (len(prices)+1)    # off by 1 for the right
        left_min, right_max = prices[0], prices[-1]
        ans = 0
        # Fill out dp
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            j = len(prices)-i-1
            # Fill out left_profits
            if prices[i] < left_min:
                left_min = prices[i]
            # Update dp[i] with dp[i-1] or prices[i] - curr_min
            left_profits[i] = max(left_profits[i-1], prices[i] - left_min)
            # Fill out right_profits
            if prices[j] > right_max:
                right_max = prices[j]
            # Update dp[j] with either right neighbor or curr_max - prices[i]
            right_profits[j] = max(right_profits[j+1], right_max - prices[j])
        
        # Update ans
        for i in range(len(left_profits)):
            ans = max(ans, left_profits[i] + right_profits[i+1])
        return ans
```
