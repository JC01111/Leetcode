### Question:
Design an algorithm that collects daily price quotes for some stock and returns **the span** of that stock's price for the current day.

The **span** of the stock's price in one day is the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from that day and going backward) for which the stock price was less than or equal to the price of that day.

* For example, if the prices of the stock in the last four days is `[7,2,1,2]` and the price of the stock today is `2`, then the span of today is `4` because starting from today, the price of the stock was less than or equal `2` for `4` consecutive days.

* Also, if the prices of the stock in the last four days is `[7,34,1,2]` and the price of the stock today is `8`, then the span of today is `3` because starting from today, the price of the stock was less than or equal `8` for `3` consecutive days.

Implement the `StockSpanner` class:

* `StockSpanner()` Initializes the object of the class.

* `int next(int price)` Returns the **span** of the stock's price given that today's price is `price`.

<br>

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** <br>
> ["StockSpanner", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next"] <br>
> [[], [100], [80], [60], [70], [60], [75], [85]]
> 
> **Output:** <br>
> [null, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]
>
> **Explanation:** <br>
> StockSpanner stockSpanner = new StockSpanner(); <br>
> stockSpanner.next(100); // return 1 <br>
> stockSpanner.next(80);  // return 1 <br>
> stockSpanner.next(60);  // return 1 <br>
> stockSpanner.next(70);  // return 2 <br>
> stockSpanner.next(60);  // return 1 <br>
> stockSpanner.next(75);  // return 4, because the last 4 prices (including today's price of 75) were less than or equal to today's price. <br>
> stockSpanner.next(85);  // return 6

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= price <= 10^5`

* At most `10^4` calls will be made to `next`.

<br>

### Walk-through: 
Maintain decreasing monotonic stack, when a new `price >= stack[-1][0]`, we need to remove elements backward until a previous price `prev_price > price`, we update `span` for current `price` with all the previous smaller price's span from `stack`.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class StockSpanner:

    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []    # stack[[price, span]]

    def next(self, price: int) -> int:
        # Span: how many days before were <= today's stock price (including today)

        # Maintain decreasing monotonic stack, when a new price > stack[-1][0], we need to remove elements backward until an elem > price, we also add the removed elements span into the new elem span.
        
        # if price >= stack[-1][1], update price with total prev span, pop prev elem from stack

        # stack: [[100, 1], [85, 6]]
        # res: [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]

        # TC: O(n), SC: O(n)
        span = 1
        while self.stack and price >= self.stack[-1][0]:
            # Update span with prev elem's span
            span += self.stack[-1][1]
            self.stack.pop()

        self.stack.append([price, span])

        return span
        

# Your StockSpanner object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = StockSpanner()
# param_1 = obj.next(price)
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, `n` because in the worst case, we may need to check every previous samller elements from stack. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$
