<br>

### Question:
Given an array of strings `words` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent strings.

Return the answer **sorted** by **the frequency** from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their **lexicographical order**.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
> 
> **Output:** ["i","love"]
>
> **Explanation:** "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words. <br>
> Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4
> 
> **Output:** ["the","is","sunny","day"]
>
> **Explanation:** "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= words.length <= 500`

* `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`

* `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

* `k` is in the range `[1, The number of unique words[i]]`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
Same as [347. Top K Frequent Elements](./questions/347.Top_K_Frequent_Elements(Medium).md) the heap method.

1. We first store `count` with each `word` into a `count{}`, then we `heapq.heappush()` these `word` into `minHeap[]`, `c` is the count from `count{}`, `i` is the `word` we do `(-c, i)` because we want the most count `word` to be popped out first.

2. Finally, we use a while loop to append the `word` from `minHeap` by `heapq.heappop()`, which will pop out the most count `word`.

**Note**, `heapq.heappush()` will automatically sort elements also in **lexicographical order**.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, words: List[str], k: int) -> List[str]:
        count, minHeap = {}, []
        for i in words:
            count[i] = count.get(i, 0) + 1
        for i, c in count.items():
            heapq.heappush(minHeap, (-c, i))
        res = []
        while len(res) < k:
            res.append(heapq.heappop(minHeap)[1])
        return res
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(nlog\ k)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$
