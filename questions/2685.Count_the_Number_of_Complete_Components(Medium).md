### Question:
You are given an integer n. There is an **undirected** graph with `n` vertices, numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` denotes that there exists an **undirected** edge connecting vertices `a_i` and `b_i`.

Return the number of **complete connected components** of the graph.

A **connected component** is a subgraph of a graph in which there exists a path between any two vertices, and no vertex of the subgraph shares an edge with a vertex outside of the subgraph.

A connected component is said to be **complete** if there exists an edge between every pair of its vertices.

<br>

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4]] <br>
> **Output:** 3 <br>
> **Explanation:** From the picture above, one can see that all of the components of this graph are complete.

**Example 2:**

<img src="../images/2685_2.png" width=700>

> **Input:** n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4],[3,5]] <br>
> **Output:** 1 <br>
> **Explanation:** The component containing vertices 0, 1, and 2 is complete since there is an edge between every pair of two vertices. On the other hand, the component containing vertices 3, 4, and 5 is not complete since there is no edge between vertices 4 and 5. Thus, the number of complete components in this graph is 1.

**Edge Case:**
> **Input:** n = 3, edges = [] <br>
> **Output:** 3 <br>
> **Explanation:** They are three independent connected components.

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= n <= 50`

* 0 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2

* edges[i].length == 2

* $0 <= a_i, b_i <= n - 1$

* `a_i != b_i`

* There are no repeated edges.

<br>

### Walk-through: 
**DFS Solution:** <br>
1. Build the graph for every `edge` in `edges`.

2. Run DFS for every vertex in `n`, each time we run a DFS will lead to a new connected component. Then we mark the vertices we just visit in DFS.

3. In each run of DFS, we also need to check if this connected component is valid. Follow hint3: "A connected component is complete if and only if the number of edges in the component is equal to m*(m-1)/2, where m is the number of nodes in the component." But we notice, the graph is undirected, so each edge is counted twice, so we can check if `total_edges = vertices * (vertices - 1)` to know if the current graph is complete.

<br>

**Union-Find:** <br>
1. Union edges between different nodes together.

2. Count the total number nodes and edges we have for each root.

3. Apply the formula `edges = (vertices * (vertices - 1)) / 2` to check completeness.

### DFS Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def countCompleteComponents(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Build a graph
        # Run DFS on n with a set(), each run increment ccs by 1
        # Complete: # edges = m*(m-1)/2

        # TC: O(n+m), n is total vertices, m is total edges, SC: O(n+m)
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for u, v in edges:
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)
        visited = set()
        ans = 0
        # Run DFS and check if the graph is complete
        def dfs(i):
            edges, vertices = 0, 1
            stack = [i]
            while stack:
                node = stack.pop()
                for nei in graph[node]:
                    edges += 1
                    if nei not in visited:
                        visited.add(nei)
                        stack.append(nei)
                        vertices += 1
            # Validate complete graph: every node should have an edge to other nodes, so the total edges is node * (node - 1)
            if edges == (vertices * (vertices-1)):
                return True
            return False
        # Count Connected Components
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in visited:
                visited.add(i)
                if dfs(i):
                    ans += 1
        return ans
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n+m)$, DFS to visit all the nodes and edges <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n+m)$, build undirected graph

### Union-Find Solution:
```python
class UF:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.root = [i for i in range(n)]
        self.rank = [0] * n

    # Find the root, O(a(n)) ≈ O(1)
    def find(self, x):
        if x != self.root[x]:
            self.root[x] = self.find(self.root[x])
        return self.root[x]

    # O(a(n)) ≈ O(1)
    def union(self, x, y):
        rootX, rootY = self.find(x), self.find(y)
        if rootX != rootY:
            # Higher rank will be the root
            if self.rank[rootX] < self.rank[rootY]:
                self.root[rootX] = rootY
            elif self.rank[rootY] < self.rank[rootX]:
                self.root[rootY] = rootX
            else:
                self.root[rootY] = rootX
                self.rank[rootX] += 1

class Solution:
    def countCompleteComponents(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Union Find: root[], rank{}
        # Build rank from edges, then traverse n to save each node into their root's [] (count how many vertices for current complete graph)
        # Then, loop over edges, for u in [u, v], we find u's root and increment edges{}

        # TC: O(m + n), m is total edges, SC: O(n)
        uf = UF(n)
        vertices_cnt, edges_cnt = collections.defaultdict(int), collections.defaultdict(int)
        # Union vertices together
        for u, v in edges:
            uf.union(u, v)
        # Count vertices
        for i in range(n):
            root = uf.find(i)
            vertices_cnt[root] += 1
        # Count edges
        for u, v in edges:
            root = uf.find(u)
            edges_cnt[root] += 1
        # Check complete graph
        ans = 0
        for root in vertices_cnt:
            vertices = vertices_cnt[root]
            if edges_cnt[root] == ((vertices * (vertices - 1)) / 2):
                ans += 1
        return ans
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n+m)$, we have `m` edges, and each edge will cost roughly `O(1)` to union vertices together. Then we have `n` vertices and each `find()` takes `O(1)` to count vertices for each root. `O(m)` to count edges again. And finally another `O(n)` to check complete graph. In total, we have `O(m + n + m + n) = O(m + n)`. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, we use space on `self.root, self.rank, cc_vertices, cc_edges`, they all use `O(n)` space.
