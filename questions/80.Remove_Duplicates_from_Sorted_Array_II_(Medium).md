### Question:
Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove some duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears **at most twice**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the same.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the **first part** of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.

Return `k` after placing the final result in the first `k` slots of `nums`.

Do **not** allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by **modifying the input array in-place** with O(1) extra memory.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
> 
> **Output:** 5, nums = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, _]
>
> **Explanation:** Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively. <br> It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** nums = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3]
> 
> **Output:** 7, nums = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, _, _]
>
> **Explanation:** Your function should return k = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively. <br> It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

<br>

### KeyPoints: 
We need two pointers `l, r`, the `l` is used to indicate the current nonrepeated position, we use `r` to go through all the `repeated` positions and use `count` to update $l^\text{th}$ element, remember we only want `count = min(2, count)`, either the `count` is only `1` or if `count` repeats more than twice, but `count` will be only `2`.

<br>

### My Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, 0
        while r < len(nums):
            count = 1
            while r + 1 < len(nums) and nums[r] == nums[r+1]:
                r += 1
                count += 1
            count = min(2, count)
            for i in range(count):
                nums[l] = nums[r]
                l += 1
            r += 1
        return l
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
