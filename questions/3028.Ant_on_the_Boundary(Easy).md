### Question:
An ant is on a boundary. It sometimes goes **left** and sometimes **right**.

You are given an array of **non-zero** integers `nums`. The ant starts reading `nums` from the first element of it to its end. At each step, it moves according to the value of the current element:

* If `nums[i] < 0`, it moves **left** by `-nums[i]` units.

* If `nums[i] > 0`, it moves **right** by `nums[i]` units.

Return the number of times the ant **returns** to the boundary.

**Notes:**

* There is an infinite space on both sides of the boundary.

* We check whether the ant is on the boundary only after it has moved `|nums[i]|` units. In other words, if the ant crosses the boundary during its movement, it does not count.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** nums = [2,3,-5]
> 
> **Output:** 1
>
> **Explanation:** After the first step, the ant is 2 steps to the right of the boundary. <br>
> After the second step, the ant is 5 steps to the right of the boundary. <br>
> After the third step, the ant is on the boundary.  <br>
> So the answer is 1.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** nums = [3,2,-3,-4]
> 
> **Output:** 0
>
> **Explanation:** After the first step, the ant is 3 steps to the right of the boundary. <br>
> After the second step, the ant is 5 steps to the right of the boundary. <br>
> After the third step, the ant is 2 steps to the right of the boundary. <br>
> After the fourth step, the ant is 2 steps to the left of the boundary. <br>
> The ant never returned to the boundary, so the answer is 0.

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= nums.length <= 100`

* `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`

* `nums[i] != 0`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
Use two variables `res, curSum` to keep track of result and current prefix sum. Everytime, we update `curSum` and we check if `curSum == 0`, so we can increment `res += 1`.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def returnToBoundaryCount(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # returns to the boundary if sum = 0
        # Two variables: res, curSum
        # Use curSum to keep track of summation so far
        # If curSum == 0, update res += 1

        # TC: O(n), SC: O(1)
        res = 0
        curSum = nums[0]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            curSum += nums[i]
            if curSum == 0:
                res += 1
        
        return res
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, `n` is the length of `nums`. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
