### Question:
Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its neighbors.

```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```

<br>

**Test case format:**

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with `val == 1`, the second node with `val == 2`, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

**An adjacency list** is a collection of unordered **lists** used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

<br>

**Example 1:**

<img src="../images/133.png" width=500>

> **Input:** adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
> 
> **Output:** [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
>
> **Explanation:** There are 4 nodes in the graph. <br>
> 1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4). <br>
> 2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3). <br>
> 3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4). <br>
> 4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

**Example 2:**

<img src="../images/133_1.png" width=150>

> **Input:** adjList = [[]]
> 
> **Output:** [ [] ]
>
> **Explanation:** Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** adjList = []
> 
> **Output:** []
>
> **Explanation:** This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.

#### Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the graph is in the range `[0, 100]`.

* `1 <= Node.val <= 100`

* `Node.val` is unique for each node.

* There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.

* The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

### Walk-through: 
Similar to [138. Copy List with Random Pointer](./138.Copy_List_With_Random_Pointer(Medium).md), we use a `hashmap{}` to store the old node's copy. 

1. We run **dfs** to check if a node's neighbor or a node itself is in the hashmap or not, which means they have created a copy or not. 

2. We create a copy of current node by its `node.val` and run **dfs** on all the original node's neighbors and append their copy to the new node's neighbors.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = None):
        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []
"""

from typing import Optional
class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node: Optional['Node']) -> Optional['Node']:
        # Run DFS to add all its neighbors into node.neighbors
        # Base cases: if node in hashmap, append the node
        # First loop, create copy for all nodes
        # Second loop, we will be able to append all the copies into each node.neighbors

        # hashmap: {1: Node(1), 2: Node(2), 3: Node(3), 4: Node(4)}
        # neighbors: {1:[2, 4], 2:[3, 1], 3:[4, 2], 4:[1, 3]}

        # TC: O(n), n is total nodes, SC: O(n)
        hashmap = {}
        def dfs(node):
            if node in hashmap:
                return hashmap[node]
            # Create copy of node
            hashmap[node] = Node(node.val)
            # Append all node's neighbors
            for nei in node.neighbors:
                hashmap[node].neighbors.append(dfs(nei))
            return hashmap[node]
        # Check if node is None
        return dfs(node) if node else None
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$
