### Question:
There are several consecutive houses along a street, each of which has some money inside. There is also a robber, who wants to steal money from the homes, but he **refuses to steal from adjacent homes**.

The **capability** of the robber is the maximum amount of money he steals from one house of all the houses he robbed.

You are given an integer array `nums` representing how much money is stashed in each house. More formally, the `ith` house from the left has `nums[i]` dollars.

You are also given an integer `k`, representing the **minimum** number of houses the robber will steal from. It is always possible to steal at least `k` houses.

Return the **minimum** capability of the robber out of all the possible ways to steal at least `k` houses.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** nums = [2,3,5,9], k = 2 <br>
> **Output:** 5 <br>
> **Explanation:** <br>
> There are three ways to rob at least 2 houses:
> - Rob the houses at indices 0 and 2. Capability is max(nums[0], nums[2]) = 5.
> - Rob the houses at indices 0 and 3. Capability is max(nums[0], nums[3]) = 9.
> - Rob the houses at indices 1 and 3. Capability is max(nums[1], nums[3]) = 9.
Therefore, we return min(5, 9, 9) = 5.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** nums = [2,7,9,3,1], k = 2 <br>
> **Output:** 2 <br>
> **Explanation:** There are 7 ways to rob the houses. The way which leads to minimum capability is to rob the house at index 0 and 4. Return max(nums[0], nums[4]) = 2.

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`

* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

* `1 <= k <= (nums.length + 1)/2`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
Run Binary Search on range `[1, max(nums)]`, we can get the number `nums[m]` and use it to compare with each num in `nums`, to count how many houses we can rob, if `counts >= k`, we can update `r = m`, otherwise, update `l = m + 1`.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def minCapability(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Start BS on range of rewards [1, max(nums)] to find a capability
        # Iterate nums to count how many houses <= capability, increment counts
        # If counts >= k, try to find a smaller capability by updating r = m - 1

        # TC: O(nlog(m)), n=len(nums), m=max(nums), SC: O(1)
        l, r = 1, max(nums)
        while l < r:
            m = (l+r) // 2      # capability
            # Compare nums[i] with m to count how many houses can be robbed
            i = 0
            counts = 0
            while i < len(nums):
                # If rob current house, skip the next house
                if nums[i] <= m:
                    counts += 1
                    i += 2
                else:
                    i += 1
            # Check if counts >= k and update l, r
            if counts >= k:
                r = m
            else:
                l = m + 1
        return l
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(nlog(m))$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
