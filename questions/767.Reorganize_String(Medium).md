### Walk-through: 
1. Build hashmap for each char with their counts.

2. Convert hashmap into maxHeap with `[-counts, char]`.

3. First pop the most frequent char `char1` from `maxHeap[]`, then append it to `ans[]` if `ans[]` is empty or `char1 != ans[-1]` it doesn't equal to the last char in `ans[]` (avoid duplicate). If not, we are going pop the second most frequent char `char2`, but before we do that, we need to check if `maxHeap[]` now is empty, if so, we return `""`. Otherwise, we can append `char2`. Don't forget to update the `counts + 1` after we append `char1` or `char2` correspondingly. If we add `char2`, don't forget to put back `char1` with just `count1`.

### maxHeap:
```python
class Solution:
    def reorganizeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Q: Rearrange s to have no adjacent chars are the same
        # S: 1. Use hashmap to save each char in s with cnts
        # 2. Convert hashmap into maxHeap with most frequent char on top
        # 3. After pop the 1st char, check if its cnt == 1, if so, check if maxHeap is empty or not. If empty: valid. If its cnt > 1 but maxHeap is empty, return ""
        # Decrement each char's cnt and push back to maxHeap
        # TC: O(nlogk), n=len(s), k=len(distinct(s)), SC: O(k)

        hashmap = {}    # {char: cnt}
        for c in s:
            hashmap[c] = hashmap.get(c, 0) + 1
        # Convert hashmap into maxHeap
        maxHeap = []    # [-cnt, val]
        for k, v in hashmap.items():
            heapq.heappush(maxHeap, [-v, k])
        ans = ""
        # Pop chars from maxHeap and update ans
        while maxHeap:
            # Get the 1st char
            cnt1, char1 = heapq.heappop(maxHeap)
            ans += char1
            # Check if we can get 2nd char
            if len(maxHeap) > 0:
                cnt2, char2 = heapq.heappop(maxHeap)
                ans += char2
                # Check if we need to push char2 back after consume
                if cnt2 + 1 < 0:
                    heapq.heappush(maxHeap, [cnt2+1, char2])
            # Invalid if char1 has more than one but maxHeap is empty
            elif len(maxHeap) == 0 and cnt1 < -1:
                return ""
            # Check if we need to push char1 back after consume
            if cnt1 + 1 < 0:
                heapq.heappush(maxHeap, [cnt1+1, char1])
        return ans
```
