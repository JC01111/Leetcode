### Question:
Given a string `s`, rearrange the characters of `s` so that any two adjacent characters are not the same.

Return any possible rearrangement of `s` or return `""` if not possible.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** s = "aab" <br>
> **Output:** "aba"

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** s = "aaab" <br>
> **Output:** ""

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= s.length <= 500`

* `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

<br>

### Walk-through: 
1. Build hashmap for each char with their counts.

2. Convert hashmap into maxHeap with `[-counts, char]`.

3. First pop the most frequent char `char1` from `maxHeap[]`, then append it to `ans[]` if `ans[]` is empty or `char1 != ans[-1]` it doesn't equal to the last char in `ans[]` (avoid duplicate). If not, we are going pop the second most frequent char `char2`, but before we do that, we need to check if `maxHeap[]` now is empty, if so, we return `""`. Otherwise, we can append `char2`. Don't forget to update the `counts + 1` after we append `char1` or `char2` correspondingly. If we add `char2`, don't forget to put back `char1` with just `count1`.

### Straight-forward minHeap soln:
```python
class Solution:
    def reorganizeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        # First count s with occurrences, place char alternatively
        # After we pop the 1st char out and decrement, 1st char is not empty and heap is out, return ""

        # TC: O(nlogk), n=len(s), k is distinct chars in s, SC: O(k)
        heap = []
        hashmap = {}
        ans = ""
        for i in s:
            hashmap[i] = hashmap.get(i, 0) + 1
        for key, cnts in hashmap.items():
            heapq.heappush(heap, [-cnts, key])
        while heap:
            cnt1, char1 = heapq.heappop(heap)
            ans += char1
            if heap:
                cnt2, char2 = heapq.heappop(heap)
                ans += char2
                if cnt2 + 1 != 0:
                    heapq.heappush(heap, [cnt2+1, char2])
            else:
                # When we don't have next char, but char1 still valids
                if cnt1+1 != 0:
                    return ""
            if cnt1 + 1 != 0:
                heapq.heappush(heap, [cnt1+1, char1])
        return ans
```

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def reorganizeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Build hashmap {char: counts} and convert into maxHeap with [-cnt, char]
        # Valid to add char1: ans is empty or first_char != ans[-1]
        # Otherwise, add char2 and don't forget to add char1 back to maxHeap

        # TC: O(nlogk), n=len(s), k= # distinct char, SC: O(k)
        hashmap = {}
        maxHeap = []
        ans = []
        # Build the hashmap
        for i in s:
            hashmap[i] = hashmap.get(i, 0) + 1
        # Fill in maxHeap
        for char, counts in hashmap.items():
            heapq.heappush(maxHeap, [-counts, char])
        # Append ans
        while maxHeap:
            cnt1, char1 = heapq.heappop(maxHeap)
            # Check if valid to append char1
            if len(ans) == 0 or char1 != ans[-1]:
                ans.append(char1)
                # Check if should add char back to maxHeap
                if cnt1 + 1 != 0:
                    heapq.heappush(maxHeap, [cnt1+1, char1])
            # Case to append char2
            else:
                # When maxHeap is empty, return ""
                if len(maxHeap) == 0:
                    return ""
                cnt2, char2 = heapq.heappop(maxHeap)
                ans.append(char2)
                # Check if should add char back to maxHeap
                if cnt2 + 1 != 0:
                    heapq.heappush(maxHeap, [cnt2+1, char2])
                # Don't forget to put back char1
                heapq.heappush(maxHeap, [cnt1, char1])
        return "".join(ans)
```
