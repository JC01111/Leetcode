### Question:
You are given two string arrays `username` and `website` and an integer array `timestamp`. All the given arrays are of the same length and the tuple `[username[i], website[i], timestamp[i]]` indicates that the user `username[i]` visited the website `website[i]` at time `timestamp[i]`.

A **pattern** is a list of three websites (not necessarily distinct).

* For example, ["home", "away", "love"], ["leetcode", "love", "leetcode"], and ["luffy", "luffy", "luffy"] are all patterns.

The **score** of a **pattern** is the number of users that visited all the websites in the pattern in the same order they appeared in the pattern.

* For example, if the pattern is `["home", "away", "love"]`, the score is the number of users `x` such that `x` visited `"home"` then visited `"away"` and visited `"love"` after that.

* Similarly, if the pattern is `["leetcode", "love", "leetcode"]`, the score is the number of users `x` such that `x` visited `"leetcode"` then visited `"love"` and visited `"leetcode"` **one more time** after that.

* Also, if the pattern is `["luffy", "luffy", "luffy"]`, the score is the number of users `x` such that `x` visited `"luffy"` three different times at different timestamps.

Return the **pattern** with the largest **score**. If there is more than one pattern with the same largest score, return the lexicographically smallest such pattern.

Note that the websites in a pattern **do not** need to be visited contiguously, they only need to be visited in the order they appeared in the pattern.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** username = ["joe","joe","joe","james","james","james","james","mary","mary","mary"], timestamp = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], website = ["home","about","career","home","cart","maps","home","home","about","career"] <br>
> **Output:** ["home","about","career"] <br>
> **Explanation:** 
```
The tuples in this example are:
["joe","home",1],["joe","about",2],["joe","career",3],["james","home",4],["james","cart",5],["james","maps",6],["james","home",7],["mary","home",8],["mary","about",9], and ["mary","career",10].
The pattern ("home", "about", "career") has score 2 (joe and mary).
The pattern ("home", "cart", "maps") has score 1 (james).
The pattern ("home", "cart", "home") has score 1 (james).
The pattern ("home", "maps", "home") has score 1 (james).
The pattern ("cart", "maps", "home") has score 1 (james).
The pattern ("home", "home", "home") has score 0 (no user visited home 3 times).
```

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** username = ["ua","ua","ua","ub","ub","ub"], timestamp = [1,2,3,4,5,6], website = ["a","b","a","a","b","c"] <br>
> **Output:** ["a","b","a"]

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** username = ["dowg","dowg","dowg"], timestamp = [158931262,562600350,148438945], website = ["y","loedo","y"] <br>
> **Output:** ["y","y","loedo"]

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `3 <= username.length <= 50`

* `1 <= username[i].length <= 10`

* `timestamp.length == username.length`

* `1 <= timestamp[i] <= 10^9`

* `website.length == username.length`

* `1 <= website[i].length <= 10`

* `username[i]` and `website[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.

* It is guaranteed that there is at least one user who visited at least three websites.

* All the tuples `[username[i], timestamp[i], website[i]]` are **unique**.

### Walk-through: 
1. Zip (timestamp, username, webstie) together, and sort the zipped logs by `timestamp`. Because `timestamp` is not sorted, we have to make sure each website follow the ascending timestamp to form pattern.

2. Loop over `logs` and associate each site with the user, we will have `user_sites` dictionary, where we save all the websites that a user has.

3. Loop over `user_sites` to form combination from each user's website list, associate the pattern we form with the user in `pattern_user` dictionary. Remember to add user to `set()` instead of `list[]` to avoid duplicate users.

4. Loop over `pattern_user` to check how many users we have for each pattern by comparing the length of `users`, if they have the same length, we update `pattern` if the current one is lexicographically smaller than the previous pattern.

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def mostVisitedPattern(self, username: List[str], timestamp: List[int], website: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        # Zip (timestamp, username, website), sort by timestamp, O(n)
        # Loop over zipped logs, save each website with the user
        # Form combination from each user's sites to form combination
        # Use pattern_user dictionary to map each pattern with user
        # Find patterns, know how many users for each pattern
        # If a new pattern has more users, we update. Or, a new pattern has same number of users update the smaller lexicographical one

        # TC: O(n), n=len(username), SC: O(n)
        logs = sorted(zip(timestamp, username, website))

        # user_sites {user: [websites]}
        user_sites = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for _, user, site in logs:
            user_sites[user].append(site)

        # pattern_user {pattern: set(users)}
        pattern_users = collections.defaultdict(set)
        for user, sites in user_sites.items():
            patterns = set(combinations(sites, 3))
            # Associate each pattern with user
            for pat in patterns:
                pattern_users[pat].add(user)
        
        # Find the max score pattern
        score, pattern = 0, None
        for pat, users in pattern_users.items():
            # when pattern has more users or same len but smaller letter
            if len(users) > score or (len(users) == score and pat < pattern):
                score = len(users)
                pattern = pat
        return pattern
```

**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$
