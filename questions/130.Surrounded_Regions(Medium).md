### Question:
You are given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing **letters** `'X'` and `'O'`, **capture regions** that are **surrounded**:

* **Connect**: A cell is connected to adjacent cells horizontally or vertically.

* **Region**: To form a region **connect every** `'O'` cell.

* **Surround**: The region is surrounded with `'X'` cells if you can connect the region with `'X'` cells and none of the region cells are on the edge of the `board`.

A **surrounded region is captured** by replacing all `'O'`s with `'X'`s in the input matrix `board`.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
> 
> **Output:** [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
>
> **Explanation:**

> In the above diagram, the bottom region is not captured because it is on the edge of the board and cannot be surrounded.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** board = [["X"]]
> 
> **Output:** [["X"]]

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `m == board.length`

* `n == board[i].length`

* `1 <= m, n <= 200`

* `board[i][j]` is `'X'` or `'O'`.

<br>

### Walk-through: 
1. We know the edges of the board are the only places that we can't capture surrounded regions. So we first loop over the first row, the last row, the first column, and the last column to check if there is any `'O'` on these edges, if yes, we change these `'O'` and their neighbors to a temporary `'T'`.

We can find their neighbors by running **dfs** and save these positions (r, c) into a `set()`.

2. Now, the rest of the `'O'` on `board` can be sure to be captured. So we loop over the `board` to set `'O'` to be `'X'`.

3. We change back all the `'T'` into `'O'` from `set()`.

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        """
        visited, queue = set(), []
        tRegions = set()
        rows, cols = len(board), len(board[0])

        def bfs(r, c):
            queue.append((r, c))
            visited.add((r, c))
            while queue:
                row, col = queue.pop()
                board[row][col] = 'T'
                tRegions.add((row, col))
                directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]]
                for dr, dc in directions:
                    r, c = row + dr, col + dc
                    if r in range(rows) and c in range(cols) and board[r][c] == 'O':
                        queue.append((r, c))
                        visited.add((r, c))

        # Checking each col's first and last element            
        for c in range(len(board[0])):
            if board[0][c] == 'O':
                bfs(0, c)
            if board[rows-1][c] == 'O':
                bfs(rows-1, c)

        # Checking each row's first and last element
        for r in range(rows):
            if board[r][0] == 'O':
                bfs(r, 0)
            if board[r][cols-1] == 'O':
                bfs(r, cols-1)

        # Capture all 'O' to 'X'
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if board[r][c] == 'O':
                    board[r][c] = 'X'
        
        # Change all 'T' back into 'O'
        for r, c in tRegions:
            board[r][c] = 'O'
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(m * n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(m * n)$
