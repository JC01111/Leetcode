### Question:
Convert a **Binary Search Tree** to a sorted **Circular Doubly-Linked List** in place.

You can think of the left and right pointers as synonymous to the predecessor and successor pointers in a doubly-linked list. For a circular doubly linked list, the predecessor of the first element is the last element, and the successor of the last element is the first element.

We want to do the transformation **in place**. After the transformation, the left pointer of the tree node should point to its predecessor, and the right pointer should point to its successor. You should return the pointer to the smallest element of the linked list.

<br>

**Example 1:**

> **Input:** root = [4,2,5,1,3]

<img src="../images/426_2.png" width=500>

> 
> **Output:** [1,2,3,4,5]
>
> **Explanation:** The figure below shows the transformed BST. The solid line indicates the successor relationship, while the dashed line means the predecessor relationship.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** root = [2,1,3]
> 
> **Output:** [1,2,3]

<br>

#### Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.

* `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

* All the values of the tree are **unique**.

<br>

### Walk-through: 
1. We notice the order of sorted doubly linked list is the same order as running DFS in-order traversal. We create `head = dummy` to connect `head` with the most-left child node, so we can update `head.right = node`, `node.left = head`, after that, we update `head = node`.

2. Finally, we can connect the most-left node with the right-most node by `dummy.right.left, head.right = head, dummy.right`. Return `dummy.right` which is the first node in the linked list.

### Python Solution:
```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
"""

class Solution:
    def treeToDoublyList(self, root: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        # Run DFS in-order traversal. Initialize a dummy head, when we reach the deep left node, set head.right to be node, and set node.left to be head, so each two nodes are circular to each other
        
        # TC: O(n), n is total nodes, SC: O(1)
        if not root:
            return root
        head = dummy = Node()
        def dfs(node):
            nonlocal head
            if not node:
                return 
            dfs(node.left)
            # Connect two nodes together to be circular
            head.right = node
            node.left = head
            # Update head to be current node
            head = node
            dfs(node.right)
        dfs(root)
        # Connect head and tail together
        dummy.right.left, head.right = head, dummy.right
        return dummy.right
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
