### Question:
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns three possible results:

* `-1`: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. `num > pick`).

* `1`: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. `num < pick`).

* `0`: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. `num == pick`).

Return _the number that I picked_.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** n = 10, pick = 6
> 
> **Output:** 6

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** n = 1, pick = 1
> 
> **Output:** 1

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** n = 2, pick = 1
> 
> **Output:** 1

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`

* `1 <= pick <= n`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
Use `l, r` pointers to find the `m = (l + r) // 2` and we use it to find either this guessing value is high or low. If high, we change the `r` pointer to be `r = m - 1`. If low, we change the `l` pointer to be `l = m + 1`. Return `m` when `guess(m) == 0`.

### Python Solution:
```python
# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if num is higher than the picked number
#          1 if num is lower than the picked number
#          otherwise return 0
# def guess(num: int) -> int:

class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        # Binary search to find n
        # l, r from 1 to n first, compare with m = (l + r) // 2
        # depends on output, change l, r to be 1 -> m-1 or m+1 -> r
        # until res == 0, return this m

        # TC: O(logn), SC: O(1)
        l, r = 1, n
        while l <= r:
            m = (l + r) // 2
            if guess(m) == 0:
                return m 
            # When guess is higher
            elif guess(m) == -1:
                r = m - 1
            # When guess is lower
            elif guess(m) == 1:
                l = m + 1
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(log\ n)$, `n` is the number we will try most, and this is binary search. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
