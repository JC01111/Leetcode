### Question:
Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return _the length of their longest **common subsequence**_. If there is no **common subsequence**, return `0`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

* For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
> 
> **Output:** 3
>
> **Explanation:** The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
> 
> **Output:** 3
>
> **Explanation:** The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
> 
> **Output:** 0
>
> **Explanation:** There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000`

* `text1` and `text2` consist of only lowercase English characters.

<br>

### Walk-through: 
**First Approach:**

1. Build a dp table `(len(text1) + 1) * (len(text2) + 1)` with value `0`. And we store each `dp[r][c]` to be the current longest common subsequence length.

2. If `text1[r-1] == text2[c-1]` that means we have a same character, and we should update `dp[r][c] = dp[r-1][c-1] + 1`, which is the previous LCS length we know, plus this current match.

3. If they don't match, we should update `dp[r][c] = max(dp[r-1][c], dp[r][c-1])`.

4. Finally, return the last grid of `dp`.

**Note** that we compare two texts by `text1[r-1]` and `text2[c-1]` instead of `text1[r]` and `text2[c]`, because we have an extra `0` in front of each column and each row for the base case.

```
Example 1:
            a c e
          0 0 0 0
        a 0 1 1 1
        b 0 1 1 1
        c 0 1 2 2
        d 0 1 2 2
        e 0 1 2 3

Example 2:
            a b c
          0 0 0 0
        a 0 1 1 1
        b 0 1 2 2
        c 0 1 2 3
```

<br>

**Similar Approach:**
We can also start filling the dp backward from bottom up, right to left.

<br>

**Optimized Approach:**
The optimized solution we just use an `1 x n` array as `dp` instead of having a 2d `dp`. Which saves the previous row's value. Each time in the loop of `c`, we use `tmp` to store the current value of `dp[c]`, because we are going to overwrite it later with either they have a match or not. 

If they are matched, we udpate `dp[c] = 1 + prev`, because `prev` is `[r-1][c-1]`. If they are not matched, we upate `dp[c] = max(dp[c], dp[c-1])`, we are finding the `max([r-1][c], [r][c-1])`.

After updating `dp[c]`, we can update `prev = tmp`, which has the same effect as `dp[r-1][c-1]`, the value of previous column.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
        # DP[i][j] = DP[i - 1][j - 1] + 1 , if text1[i] == text2[j] 
        # DP[i][j] = max(DP[i - 1][j], DP[i][j - 1]) , otherwise
        dp = [[0] * (len(text2) + 1) for _ in range(len(text1) + 1)]
        for r in range(1, len(text1)+1):
            for c in range(1, len(text2)+1):
                if text1[r-1] == text2[c-1]:
                    dp[r][c] = dp[r-1][c-1] + 1
                else:
                    dp[r][c] = max(dp[r-1][c], dp[r][c-1])
        return dp[len(text1)][len(text2)]
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(m * n)$, `m` is length of `text1`, `n` is length of `text2`. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(m * n)$

<br>

### Python DP Optimized Solution:
**Note** that we now don't need to loop over an extra row in the beginning, so just `range(len(text1))`.
```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
        prev = [0] * (len(text2)+1)
        for r in range(len(text1)):
            dp = [0] * (len(text2)+1)
            for c in range(1, len(text2)+1):
                if text1[r] == text2[c-1]:
                    dp[c] = prev[c-1] + 1
                else:
                    dp[c] = max(prev[c], dp[c-1])
            prev = dp
        return prev[-1]
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(m * n)$, `m` is length of `text1`, `n` is length of `text2`. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, now we are only storing the length of `text2`.

<br>

### Python Optimized with 1 Variable:
```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (len(text2) + 1)    # For previous row
        for r in range(1, len(text1)+1):
            prev = 0    # Default val for each row's prev
            for c in range(1, len(text2)+1):
                tmp = dp[c]    # [r-1][c]
                if text1[r-1] == text2[c-1]:
                    dp[c] = 1 + prev
                else:
                    dp[c] = max(dp[c], dp[c-1])
                prev = tmp    # [r-1][c-1]
        return dp[-1]
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(m * n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$
