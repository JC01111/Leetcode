### Question:
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.**

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**._

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]
> 
> **Output:** 4
>
> **Explanation:** Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3). Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** nums = [2, 7, 9, 3, 1]
> 
> **Output:** 12
>
> **Explanation:** Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1). Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** [1, 4, 2, 5]
> 
> **Output:** 9

**Edge Case:**
> **Input:** [2, 1, 1, 2]
> 
> **Output:** 4

<br>

### KeyPoints: 
1. For each house in `dp[i]`, we want to find if we should take the `i-1`th (previous) house or `nums[i] + i-2` (current) house. So we should have `0` at the very beginning of `dp[]` and manually add `dp[1] = nums[0]`, because the first house has no choice to choose, but any house after the first one have choice.

Example 1: nums = [1,2,3,1], dp = [0, 1, 2, 3, 1].

2. After the base case, we start from `range(2, len(nums)+1)`, and follow the recurrence relation `dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])`. Finally we just return the last element in `dp[len(nums)]`, which will be the maximum you can rob.

Example 1: `dp = [0, 1, 2, 4, 4]`, return `dp[len(nums)] = 4`.

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (len(nums) + 1)
        dp[1] = nums[0]
        for i in range(2, len(nums)+1):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i-1])
        return dp[len(nums)]
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$
