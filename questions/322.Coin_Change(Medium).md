### Question:
You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total `amount` of money.

Return _the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount_. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
> 
> **Output:** 3
>
> **Explanation:** 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** coins = [2], amount = 3
> 
> **Output:** -1

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** coins = [1], amount = 0
> 
> **Output:** 0

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= coins.length <= 12`

* `1 <= coins[i] <= 2^{31} - 1`

* `0 <= amount <= 10^4`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
We can use dp bottom-up method to store the value of each amount `a` from `0` to `amount` with the minimum number of coins we need to achieve for each `a`.

1. initialize `dp` with a biggest number `amount + 1` with size `(amount + 1)`, because the base case to achieve `amount = 0`, we need `0` coin. So we add `dp[0] = 0`.

2. Start building `dp` from `range(1, amount + 1)`, we try each `c` from `coins`, if current amount `a - c >= 0`, we can update `dp[a] = min(dp[a], 1 + dp[a-c])`, which means current coin `c` can be used, and we update `dp[a]` by the recurrence relation above, we assume we take this coin `c`, how many coins to take for the difference, so we have `1 + dp[a-c]`.

3. Finally, return the last element in `dp[amount]`, but we need to make sure we have changed the `dp[amount]`, otherwise, we should return `-1`.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        dp = [amount + 1] * (amount + 1)
        dp[0] = 0
        for a in range(1, amount+1):
            for c in coins:
                if a - c >= 0:
                    dp[a] = min(dp[a], 1 + dp[a-c])
        return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != amount + 1 else -1
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n * m)$, `n` is `len(coins)`, `m` is `amount`. Because each value of `amount` we try all the coins. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(m)$
