### Question:
You are given an array `nums` of `n` integers and two integers `k` and `x`.

The **x-sum** of an array is calculated by the following procedure:

* Count the occurrences of all elements in the array.

* Keep only the occurrences of the top `x` most frequent elements. If two elements have the same number of occurrences, the element with the **bigger** value is considered more frequent.

* Calculate the sum of the resulting array.

**Note** that if an array has less than x distinct elements, its x-sum is the sum of the array.

Return an integer array `answer` of length `n - k + 1` where `answer[i]` is the **x-sum** of the subarray `nums[i..i + k - 1]`.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** nums = [1,1,2,2,3,4,2,3], k = 6, x = 2
> 
> **Output:** [6,10,12]
>
> **Explanation:** <br>
> * For subarray `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`, only elements 1 and 2 will be kept in the resulting array. Hence, `answer[0] = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2`.
> * For subarray `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2]`, only elements 2 and 4 will be kept in the resulting array. Hence, `answer[1] = 2 + 2 + 2 + 4`. Note that 4 is kept in the array since it is bigger than 3 and 1 which occur the same number of times.
> * For subarray `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3]`, only elements 2 and 3 are kept in the resulting array. Hence, `answer[2] = 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3`.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** nums = [3,8,7,8,7,5], k = 2, x = 2
> 
> **Output:** [11,15,15,15,12]
>
> **Explanation:** <br>
> Since `k == x`, `answer[i]` is equal to the sum of the subarray `nums[i..i + k - 1]`.

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= n == nums.length <= 50`

* `1 <= nums[i] <= 50`

* `1 <= x <= k <= nums.length`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
1. Maintain a `hashmap{}` to keep the occurences of elements within current length `k` sliding window.

2. Follow the hint to create a `x_sum()` function and pass in `hashmap{}` to calculate the x-sum. In the `x_sum()` function, we use `maxHeap[]` to keep track of the top `x` frequent elements, and the way we sort `maxHeap[]` is by `counts` and `keys` (`[-val, -key]`), so we ensure the most frequent elements sort in top, and breaking tie by the value of bigger element.

3. Each time we call `x_sum()` and append the result into the `res[]`. And we update the hashmap by first removing the prev sliding window's left-most element, then adding the new element into `hashmap[]`. 

<br>

### Python Brute Force:
```python
class Solution:
    def findXSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int, x: int) -> List[int]:
        # To form an arrary with length n-k+1
        # For each answer[i], find subarray with length k, x-sum
        # x-sum: the top x frequent elements sum
        # Sliding window with length k, each time we maintain the x-sum with a hashmap, hashmap contains all elements occurences

        # TC: O(n^2), SC: O(n^2)
        res = []
        n = len(nums)
        hashmap = {}    # Save elements with occurences

        # X-sum func, input: arrary, output: sum
        def x_sum(arr):
            hashmap = {}
            maxHeap = []    # Get the top x elements from here
            res = 0
            for i in arr:
                hashmap[i] = hashmap.get(i, 0) + 1
            for key, val in hashmap.items():
                heapq.heappush(maxHeap, [-val, -key])
            for _ in range(x):
                if maxHeap:
                    val, key = heapq.heappop(maxHeap)
                    res += val * key
            return res
        
        # Maintain a sliding window with size k
        for i in range(n-k+1):
            res.append(x_sum(nums[i:i+k]))
        return res
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$

<br>

### Python Optimized Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def findXSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int, x: int) -> List[int]:
        # Maintain hashmap and pass in x_sum()

        # TC: O(nlogk), SC: O(k)
        res = []
        n = len(nums)
        hashmap = Counter(nums[:k])

        # X-sum func, input: arrary, output: sum
        def x_sum(hashmap):
            maxHeap = []    # Get the top x elements from here
            res = 0
            for key, val in hashmap.items():
                heapq.heappush(maxHeap, [-val, -key])
            for _ in range(min(len(maxHeap), x)):
                val, key = heapq.heappop(maxHeap)
                res += val * key
            return res
        
        # Run the first time for nums[:k]
        res.append(x_sum(hashmap))
        # Maintain a sliding window with size k
        for i in range(1, n-k+1):
            # Remove the leftmost prev sliding window element
            hashmap[nums[i-1]] -= 1
            if hashmap[nums[i-1]] == 0:
                del hashmap[nums[i-1]]
            # Add the next element into hashmap
            hashmap[nums[i+k-1]] = hashmap.get(nums[i+k-1], 0) + 1
            # Pass the updated hashmap into x_sum()
            res.append(x_sum(hashmap))
        return res
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(nlog\ k)$, `n` is length of `nums`, `k` is just `k`. Because we involve `heapq`. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(k)$, we only store `k` elements in `maxHeap`.
