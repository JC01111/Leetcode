### Question:
You are given two strings `order` and `s`. All the characters of `order` are **unique** and were sorted in some custom order previously.

Permute the characters of `s` so that they match the order that order was sorted. More specifically, if a character `x` occurs before a character `y` in order, then `x` should occur before `y` in the permuted string.

Return any permutation of `s` that satisfies this property.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** order = "cba", s = "abcd"
> 
> **Output:** "cbad"
>
> **Explanation:** `"a"`, `"b"`, `"c"` appear in order, so the order of `"a"`, `"b"`, `"c"` should be `"c"`, `"b"`, and `"a"`.
>
> Since `"d"` does not appear in `order`, it can be at any position in the returned string. `"dcba"`, `"cdba"`, `"cbda"` are also valid outputs.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** order = "bcafg", s = "abcd"
> 
> **Output:** "bcad"
>
> **Explanation:** The characters `"b"`, `"c"`, and `"a"` from order dictate the order for the characters in `s`. The character `"d"` in `s` does not appear in `order`, so its position is flexible.
>
> Following the order of appearance in `order`, `"b"`, `"c"`, and `"a"` from `s` should be arranged as `"b"`, `"c"`, `"a"`. `"d"` can be placed at any position since it's not in order. The output `"bcad"` correctly follows this rule. Other arrangements like `"dbca"` or `"bcda"` would also be valid, as long as `"b"`, `"c"`, `"a"` maintain their order.

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= order.length <= 26`

* `1 <= s.length <= 200`

* `order` and `s` consist of lowercase English letters.

* All the characters of `order` are **unique**.

<br>

### Walk-through: 
1. Loop over `s` to save each char with their counts into `hashmap{}`.

2. Loop over `order` and check if char exists in `hashmap{}`, if so, add this char `c` with repeated times `hashmap[c]` to `res` (`res += c * hashmap[c]`). Delete this key-value pair in `hashmap{}`.

3. Loop over `hashmap{}` to add all the missing chars with their repeated times to `res`.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def customSortString(self, order: str, s: str) -> str:
        # save each char from s, {element: counts}
        # Loop over `order`, find if element in order is the key in hashmap, if so, append the number of times repeated char into res. Remove this key in hashmap.
        # Add the missing elements from hashmap into res
        
        # TC: O(n), n = len(max(order, s)), SC: O(n)
        hashmap = {}
        res = ""
        # Calculate each char in s with their frequency
        for c in s:
            hashmap[c] = hashmap.get(c, 0) + 1
        # Follow the order to append chars into res
        for c in order:
            if c in hashmap:
                res += c * hashmap[c]
                del hashmap[c]
        # Check the missing chars
        for key, val in hashmap.items():
            res += key * val
        return res
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$
