### Question:
You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and a 2D array `queries` where `queries[i] = [l_i, r_i, val_i]`.

Each `queries[i]` represents the following action on `nums`:

* Decrement the value at each index in the range `[l_i, r_i]` in nums by **at most** `val_i`.

* The amount by which each value is decremented can be chosen **independently** for each index.

A **Zero Array** is an array with all its elements equal to 0.

Return the **minimum** possible **non-negative** value of `k`, such that after processing the first `k` queries in **sequence**, nums becomes a **Zero Array**. If no such `k` exists, return -1.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** nums = [2,0,2], queries = [[0,2,1],[0,2,1],[1,1,3]] <br>
> **Output:** 2 <br>
> **Explanation:** <br>
> - For i = 0 (l = 0, r = 2, val = 1):
>   - Decrement values at indices `[0, 1, 2]` by `[1, 0, 1]` respectively.
>   - The array will become `[1, 0, 1]`.
> - For i = 1 (l = 0, r = 2, val = 1):
>   - Decrement values at indices `[0, 1, 2]` by `[1, 0, 1]` respectively.
>   - The array will become `[0, 0, 0]`, which is a Zero Array. Therefore, the minimum value of `k` is 2.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** nums = [4,3,2,1], queries = [[1,3,2],[0,2,1]] <br>
> **Output:** -1 <br>
> **Explanation:** <br>
> - For i = 0 (l = 1, r = 3, val = 2):
>   - Decrement values at indices `[1, 2, 3]` by `[2, 2, 1]` respectively.
>   - The array will become `[4, 1, 0, 0]`.
> - For i = 1 (l = 0, r = 2, val = 1):
>   - Decrement values at indices `[0, 1, 2]` by `[1, 1, 0]` respectively.
>   - The array will become `[3, 0, 0, 0]`, which is not a Zero Array.

#### Constraints:
* $1 <= \text{nums.length} <= 10^5$

* $0 <= \text{nums[i]} <= 5 * 10^5$

* $1 <= \text{queries.length} <= 10^5$

* $\text{queries[i].length} == 3$

* $0 <= l_i <= r_i < \text{nums.length}$

* $1 <= val_i <= 5$

<br>

### Walk-through: 
We use Binary Search on `queries` to find the minimum `k` we need that can make zero array.

We can check by building `difference array`, where for each `query = [l, r, v]`, we update `diff[l] += val, diff[r+1] -= val`, only two positions can represent the whole range. Because we need to calculate `prefixSum`, so if we add `val` at the beginning `left` of the range, we can keep this `val` in `prefixSum` until `right+1`, that's why we need to subtract `val` at `right+1` in the end.

Each time we update the `prefixSum`, we also need to compare it with `nums[i]` to make sure `prefixSum >= nums[i]` for every element in `nums`. Otherwise, we can return `False`.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def minZeroArray(self, nums: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Build differenceArray, +val at left, -val at right+1
        # Calculate the prefixSum and compare with each nums[i]
        # Want all current prefixSum >= nums[i]
        # Then use Binary Search to find the correct k, update to search the left of current k

        # TC: O((n+m)log(m)), m=len(queries), SC: O(n)
        def buildArray(k):
            diff = [0] * (len(nums) + 1)
            # Update diff for difference array
            for i in range(k):
                l, r, v = queries[i]
                diff[l] += v
                diff[r+1] -= v
            # Compare if prefixSum >= each elem in nums
            prefixSum = 0
            for i in range(len(nums)):
                prefixSum += diff[i]
                if prefixSum < nums[i]:
                    return False
            return True
        
        # Run Binary Search to find the correct k
        l, r = 0, len(queries)
        ans = float("inf")
        while l <= r:
            m = (l+r) // 2
            # If we successfully find one, find m's left
            if buildArray(m):
                ans = m
                r = m - 1
            else:
                l = m + 1
        return -1 if ans == float("inf") else ans
```
**Time Complexity:** $O((n+m)log(m))$, `n` is `len(nums)`, `m` is `len(queries)`. We apply Binary Search on `queries`, and each time we need to search on `nums` and `queries`. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, we create a difference array = `len(nums)+1` each time.
