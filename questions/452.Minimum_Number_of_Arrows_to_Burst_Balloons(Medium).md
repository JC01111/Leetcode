### Question:
There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array `points` where `points[i] = [x_start, x_end]` denotes a balloon whose **horizontal diameter** stretches between `x_start` and `x_end`. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up **directly vertically** (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with `x_start` and `x_end` is **burst** by an arrow shot at `x` if `x_start <= x <= x_end`. There is **no limit** to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array `points`, return _the **minimum** number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons_.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
> 
> **Output:** 2
>
> **Explanation:** The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows: <br>
> \- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6]. <br>
> \- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
> 
> **Output:** 4
>
> **Explanation:** One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
> 
> **Output:** 2
>
> **Explanation:** The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows: <br>
> \- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3]. <br>
> \- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= points.length <= 10^5`

* `points[i].length == 2`

* `-2^31 <= x_start < x_end <= 2^31 - 1`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
1. We sort `points` first so we can more easily to find the overlapping intervals.

2. We set `res = len(points)` and use `prev` to keep track of the previous overlapped interval (the range where two intervals overlapped), then we decrement `res` if we find an overlap between two intervals. We know overlap if the current interval `points[i][0] < prev[1]`, then we update `prev = [points[i][0], min(points[i][1], prev[1])]` (the range where two intervals overlapped). Otherwise, we update `prev = points[i]`.

Of course, we can use `prev` to store the last element of `points[i]`, and each time we only check if `points[i][1] <= prev`, make corresponding update to `prev`.

```
Example 1:

[1, 6]
    [2, 8] -> prev = [2, 6]
                           [7, 12]
                              [10, 16]
```

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def findMinArrowShots(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        points.sort()
        res = len(points)
        prev = points[0]
        for i in range(1, len(points)):
            if points[i][0] <= prev[1]:
                res -= 1
                prev = [points[i][0], min(points[i][1], prev[1])]
            else:
                prev = points[i]
        return res
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(nlog\ n)$, because we sort `points` and loop over `points`. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
