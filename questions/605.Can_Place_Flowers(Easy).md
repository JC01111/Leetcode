### Question:
You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in **adjacent** plots.

Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing `0`'s and `1`'s, where `0` means empty and `1` means not empty, and an integer `n`, return `true` if `n` new flowers can be planted in the `flowerbed` without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and `false` otherwise.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
> 
> **Output:** true

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
> 
> **Output:** false

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 10^4`

* `flowerbed[i]` is `0` or `1`.

* There are no two adjacent flowers in `flowerbed`.

* `0 <= n <= flowerbed.length`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
We can just append two extra `[0]` before and after `flowerbed`, so we can check `flowerbed[i-1], flowerbed[i], flowerbed[i+1]`, if they are all `0`, which means we can plant a flower and decrement `n`. Finally, we return `n <= 0`, so we know whether we can plant `n` flowers or not.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        # For each i in flowerbed, check itself and if its neighbors are 0, if so, replace 0 to be 1 and decrement n
        # Finally, check if n <= 0 to know if we can place flowers

        # 0 [1,0,0,0,1] 0
        
        # TC: O(n), n=len(flowerbed), SC: O(1)
        flowerbed = [0] + flowerbed + [0]
        for i in range(1, len(flowerbed)-1):
            if flowerbed[i] == 0 and flowerbed[i-1] == 0 and flowerbed[i+1] == 0:
                n -= 1
                flowerbed[i] = 1
        return n <= 0
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, `n` is the length of `flowerbed`. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
