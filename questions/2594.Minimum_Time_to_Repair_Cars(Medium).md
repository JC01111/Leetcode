<br>

### Question:
You are given an integer array `ranks` representing the ranks of some mechanics. ranksi is the rank of the ith mechanic. A mechanic with a rank `r` can repair n cars in `r * n^2` minutes.

You are also given an integer `cars` representing the total number of cars waiting in the garage to be repaired.

Return the **minimum** time taken to repair all the cars.

**Note**: All the mechanics can repair the cars simultaneously.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** ranks = [4,2,3,1], cars = 10 <br>
> **Output:** 16 <br>
> **Explanation:** <br>
> - The first mechanic will repair two cars. The time required is 4 * 2 * 2 = 16 minutes.
> - The second mechanic will repair two cars. The time required is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 minutes.
> - The third mechanic will repair two cars. The time required is 3 * 2 * 2 = 12 minutes.
> - The fourth mechanic will repair four cars. The time required is 1 * 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.
> It can be proved that the cars cannot be repaired in less than 16 minutes.​​

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** ranks = [5,1,8], cars = 6 <br>
> **Output:** 16 <br>
> **Explanation:** <br>
> - The first mechanic will repair one car. The time required is 5 * 1 * 1 = 5 minutes.
> - The second mechanic will repair four cars. The time required is 1 * 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.
> - The third mechanic will repair one car. The time required is 8 * 1 * 1 = 8 minutes.
> It can be proved that the cars cannot be repaired in less than 16 minutes.​​

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= ranks.length <= 10^5`

* `1 <= ranks[i] <= 100`

* `1 <= cars <= 10^6`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
Same as the previous questions, we run binary search on the total time we need to repair all the cars, which is the range `[1, min(ranks) * cars^2]` following the formula `r*n^2`.

According to the formula, we know `n` the number of cars for each rank to fix is `n = floor(sqrt(m / rank))`. If the total number of cars we can fix is greater than `cars`, we can update `r = m`, otherwise, update `l = m + 1`.

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def repairCars(self, ranks: List[int], cars: int) -> int:
        # Find the time from range [1, min(ranks)*cars^2] for total cars we can fix within given time
        # t = r * n^2, n = floor(sqrt(t/r)), if counts >= cars: update r = m
        
        # TC: O(nlog(m)), n=len(ranks), m=max(ranks), SC: O(1)
        l, r = 1, min(ranks) * cars**2
        while l < r:
            m = (l+r) // 2
            # Loop over ranks to count
            total = 0
            for rank in ranks:
                total += math.floor(sqrt(m / rank))
            # Update l, r accordingly
            if total >= cars:
                r = m
            else:
                l = m + 1
        return l
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(nlog(m))$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
