### Question:
You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer matrix `grid` of size `n * n` with values in the range `[1, n^2]`. Each integer appears **exactly once** except `a` which appears **twice** and `b` which is **missing**. The task is to find the repeating and missing numbers `a` and `b`.

Return a **0-indexed** integer array `ans` of size `2` where `ans[0]` equals to `a` and `ans[1]` equals to `b`.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** grid = [[1,3],[2,2]] <br>
> **Output:** [2,4] <br>
> **Explanation:** Number 2 is repeated and number 4 is missing so the answer is [2,4].

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** grid = [[9,1,7],[8,9,2],[3,4,6]] <br> 
> **Output:** [9,5] <br>
> **Explanation:** Number 9 is repeated and number 5 is missing so the answer is [9,5].

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `2 <= n == grid.length == grid[i].length <= 50`

* `1 <= grid[i][j] <= n * n`

* For all `x` that `1 <= x <= n * n` there is exactly one `x` that is not equal to any of the grid members.

* For all `x` that `1 <= x <= n * n` there is exactly one `x` that is equal to exactly two of the grid members.

* For all `x` that `1 <= x <= n * n` except two of them there is exatly one pair of `i, j` that `0 <= i, j <= n - 1` and `grid[i][j] == x`.

<br>

### Walk-through: 
We can use `set()` to keep track of values we have visited. So we access each element from `grid`, and add them into `set()`. If an element already exists in `set()`, we find this repeated value.

After we add all elements into `set()`, we can loop over `[1, len(grid)**2]` to find the missing element, which doesn't exist in `set()`.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def findMissingAndRepeatedValues(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        # Use set to keep track of (0, n), loop over grid, and if an element exists in set() already, this is a.
        # Loop over (0, n) again to find missing value b

        # TC: O(n^2), n=len(grid), SC: O(n^2)
        seen = set()
        ans = []
        # Add number into set() and find repeated value
        for lst in grid:
            for i in lst:
                if i in seen:
                    ans.append(i)
                seen.add(i)
        # Loop over range(1, n) to find missing value
        for i in range(1, len(grid)**2+1):
            if i not in seen:
                ans.append(i)
        return ans
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n^2)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n^2)$
