### Walk-through: 
The inituitive approach will be using minHeap to solve this problem, but the time complexity for this one will be $O(n^2 log(n)$.

So, to solve this problem we observe a pattern that if we want to form a valid group with increasing length, each `k` group has to have `k` distinct elements with at least `[1, 2, 3, ..., k]`, which is `(k * (k+1)) / 2` elements, and we know it is guarantee to be distinct, we only need to make sure for each `k` group, we have the required elements.

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxIncreasingGroups(self, usageLimits: List[int]) -> int:
        # group=1: [1], group=2: [1, 2], group=3: [1,2,3]
        # 1. For group k, we need to have k different elements.
        # 2. sum([1,2,...,k]) = (k * (k+1)) / 2
        # Notice that we need to loop over usageLimits, so the max number of groups will be len(usageLimits).
        
        # TC: O(nlogn), n=len(usageLimits), SC: O(1)
        usageLimits.sort()
        groups, total = 0, 0
        for usage in usageLimits:
            total += usage
            # Check if groups + 1 can be formed, if so, we update groups = groups + 1
            if total >= ((groups + 1) * (groups + 2) / 2):
                groups += 1
        return groups
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(nlog(n))$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
