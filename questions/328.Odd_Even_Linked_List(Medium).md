<br>

### Question:
Given the `head` of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.

The **first** node is considered **odd**, and the **second** node is **even**, and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

You must solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` time complexity.

<br>

**Example 1:**

<img src="../images/328_1.jpg" width=400>

> **Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5]
> 
> **Output:** [1,3,5,2,4]

**Example 2:**

<img src="../images/328_2.jpg" width=600>

> **Input:** head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
> 
> **Output:** [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]

<br>

#### Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.

* `-10^6 <= Node.val <= 10^6`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
Create two separate head `odd, even` to create two linked-list, and then we add the even linked-list to the end of odd.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def oddEvenList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Create two heads to save odd and even linkedlist
        # repeatedly update both linkedlist until even or even.next is none
        # Finally, add the even linkedlist to the end of odd linkedlist

        # TC: O(n), SC: O(1)
        if not head:
            return None
        # odd, even ptr
        odd = head
        even = evenHead = head.next
        while even and even.next:
            # Update odd linked-list
            odd.next = odd.next.next
            odd = odd.next
            # Update even linked-list
            even.next = even.next.next
            even = even.next
        # connect even linkedlist in the end
        odd.next = evenHead

        return head
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
