### Question:
Given a string `s` representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.

**Note:** You are **not** allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** s = "1 + 1"
> 
> **Output:** 2

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** s = " 2-1 + 2 "
> 
> **Output:** 3

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
> 
> **Output:** 23

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^5`

* `s` consists of digits, `'+'`, `'-'`, `'('`, `')'`, and `' '`.

* `s` represents a valid expression.

* `'+'` is **not** used as a unary operation (i.e., `"+1"` and `"+(2 + 3)"` is invalid).

* `'-'` could be used as a unary operation (i.e., `"-1"` and `"-(2 + 3)"` is valid).

* There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.

* Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.

<br>

### Walk-through: 
For each operation, we save the previous operation into three variables, then when we have a new operation, we update `res` with the previous operation with `sign, num`.

1. Use three variables `num, sign, res` to keep track of values, and `stack[]` for `"("`.

2. Four cases to consider:

    i. when `i.isdigit()`, we want to add this number to `num` since this variable keep track of a number before any operation, and we also need to consider a case that a number has more than one digit (`23`).

    ii. when `i in "+-"`, we need to first update `res += sign * num` (process the operation before this new operation from `sign, num`), then we change the sign to be `-1 or 1` depends on `i == "-"` or not, and we need to reset `num = 0`, so we can take next number into `num`.

    iii. when `i == "("`, we need to append `stack[res, sign]` into stack, so after we process all the operations within `()`, we can add or subtract the previous `res`.

    iv. when `i == ")"`, we can pop `res, sign` from `stack[]` and update `res` accordingly. Lastly, reset `num = 0` so we can retake new value into `res`.

3. Finally, return `res + sign * num` just in case we have cases like `s = "1 + 1"`.

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:
        # Three variables: num, sign, res and stack[] for "("
        # 1. If a number has more than one digit
        # 2. If c is "+" or "-"
        # 3. If c is "("
        # 4. If c is ")"

        # TC: O(n), SC: O(1)
        stack = []
        num, sign = 0, 1
        res = 0
        for i in s:
            if i.isdigit():
                num = num * 10 + int(i)
            elif i in "+-":
                res += sign * num
                sign = -1 if i == "-" else 1
                num = 0
            elif i == "(":
                stack.append(res)
                stack.append(sign)
                res = 0
                sign = 1
            elif i == ")":
                res += sign * num
                res *= stack.pop()
                res += stack.pop()
                num = 0
        return res + num * sign
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, `n` is the length of `s`. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
