<br>

### Question:
You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return _the merged string_.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr" <br>
> **Output:** "apbqcr" <br>
> **Explanation:** The merged string will be merged as so:
```
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
```

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs" <br>
> **Output:** "apbqrs" <br>
> **Explanation:** Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
```
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
```

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq" <br>
> **Output:** "apbqcd" <br>
> **Explanation:** Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
```
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d
```

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100`

* `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.

<br>

### Walk-through: 
Similar to how to merge two linked list, we first add chars alternately when both `i`, `j` for `word1` and `word2` have the same length, then, if `i < len(word1)` or `j < len(word2)`, we add all the rest into `res`.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        i = j = 0
        res = ""
        while i < len(word1) and j < len(word2):
            res += word1[i] + word2[j]
            i, j = i+1, j+1
        if i < len(word1) or j < len(word2):
            res += word1[i:] or word2[j:]
        return res
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n + m)$, `n` is the length of `word1`, `m` is the length of `word2`. <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n+ m)$
