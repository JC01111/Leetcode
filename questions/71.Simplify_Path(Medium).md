### Question:
You are given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which always begins with a slash `'/'`. Your task is to transform this absolute path into its **simplified canonical path**.

The rules of a Unix-style file system are as follows:

* A single period `'.'` represents the current directory.

* A double period `'..'` represents the previous/parent directory.

* Multiple consecutive slashes such as `'//'` and `'///'` are treated as a single slash `'/'`.

* Any sequence of periods that does **not match** the rules above should be treated as a **valid directory or file name**. For example, `'...'` and `'....'` are valid directory or file names.

The simplified canonical path should follow these rules:

* The path must start with a single slash `'/'`.

* Directories within the path must be separated by exactly one slash `'/'`.

* The path must not end with a slash `'/'`, unless it is the root directory.

* The path must not have any single or double periods (`'.'` and `'..'`) used to denote current or parent directories.

Return the **simplified canonical path**.

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** path = "/home/"
> 
> **Output:** "/home"
>
> **Explanation:** <br>
> The trailing slash should be removed.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** path = "/home//foo/"
> 
> **Output:** "/home/foo"
>
> **Explanation:** <br>
> Multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** path = "/home/user/Documents/../Pictures"
> 
> **Output:** "/home/user/Pictures"
>
> **Explanation:** <br>
> A double period ".." refers to the directory up a level (the parent directory).

**Example 4:**
> **Input:** path = "/../"
> 
> **Output:** "/"
>
> **Explanation:** <br>
> Going one level up from the root directory is not possible.

**Example 5:**
> **Input:** path = "/.../a/../b/c/../d/./"
> 
> **Output:** "/.../b/d"
>
> **Explanation:** <br>
> `"..."` is a valid name for a directory in this problem.

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= path.length <= 3000`

* `path` consists of English letters, digits, period `'.'`, slash `'/'` or `'_'`.

* `path` is a valid absolute Unix path.

### Walk-through: 
1. Loop over `path` and for each char `c` in `path`, we only need to check if `c == '/'` or not.

2. If `c == '/'`, when `tmp` is not empty, and `tmp != '.'`, we can append the current `tmp` into `stack[]`. So, it will avoid the multiple consecutive slashes `'//'`. <br> Also, we check `tmp != '.'` so we don't add single dot into `stack[]`, and we want to reset `tmp` to empty string.

3. For other cases, we just add `c` to `tmp`.

4. Lastly, join every path_name/directory into a string with delimiter `'/'` and we add a single slash in the beginning.

<br>

We looping over `path + '/'` to avoid cases like **Example 3**, so we can successfully add the last file name without slash into stack, also the algorithm will handle multiple consecutive slashes.

**Note:** we have to check `if stack:` separately, if not, when `stack` is empty, the `elif` condition will be `True`, so we will add `'..'` into stack.

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:
        # If c == '/': 
        # i. if tmp != "", we can stop adding char into tmp
        # ii. this is the first slash in tmp, don't do anything
        # iii. check if cur == '..'
        # Other cases we can just add cur += c and until we meet another '/', we append the word to stack
        # Lastly, join every char with delimiter "/"
        
        # TC: O(n), n = len(path), SC: O(n)
        stack = []
        tmp = ""
        for c in path + '/':
            if c == '/':
                if tmp == "..":
                    # Otherwise, '..' will be added to stack, which is wrong
                    if stack:
                        stack.pop()
                # when it's not the first slash
                elif tmp != "" and tmp != ".":
                    stack.append(tmp)
                # If there is single dot or other slashes, reset tmp
                tmp = ""
            else:
                tmp += c
        # Join every name from stack into string with '/'
        return "/" + "/".join(stack)
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$
