<br>

### Question:
You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `k`.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most `k` transactions: i.e. you may buy at most `k` times and sell at most `k` times.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** k = 2, prices = [2,4,1] <br>
> **Output:** 2 <br>
> **Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3] <br> 
> **Output:** 7 <br>
> **Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= k <= 100`

* `1 <= prices.length <= 1000`

* `0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
1. Fill out the base case for `stock`, we fill the profits in the first row to be `float("inf")`, so we know we have to buy stock to start with.

2. Next is to update `dp[(k, cash/stock)]` for the profit of `k`th transaction of holding cash/stock. And we can update `dp[(k, cash)] = max(dp[(k, cash)], dp[(k, stock)] + price)` we find the maximum of holding cash or selling stock with today's price to get cash. <br> <br> Similarly, we can update `dp[(k, stock)] = max(dp[(k, stock)], dp[(k-1, cash)] - price)` the maximum of holding stock or the profit of previous transaction holding cash and we buy stock of today's price. We repeatedly do this for transactions `(1, k+1)` and update for all `prices`.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, k: int, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        # Recurrence Relation: dp[(k, stock)] = max(dp[(k, stock)], dp[(k-1, cash)] - price)
        # dp[(k, cash)] = max(dp[(k, cash)], dp[(k, stock)] + price)

        # TC: O(n*k), n=len(prices), SC: O(n*k)
        cash, stock = 0, 1
        dp = collections.defaultdict(int)
        # Initialization of stock profit, can't start with stock
        for k in range(0, k+1):
            dp[(k, stock)] = float("-inf")
        # Fill out dp
        for price in prices:
            for trans in range(1, k+1):
                # Always start with buying stock
                # Update stock profit by holding stock or buying stock from [t-1, cash] profit - today's price
                dp[(trans, stock)] = max(dp[(trans, stock)], dp[(trans-1, cash)] - price)
                # Update cash profit by either keeping cash or selling stock with today's price
                dp[(trans, cash)] = max(dp[trans, cash], dp[trans, stock] + price)
        return dp[(k, cash)]
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n*k)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n*k)$
