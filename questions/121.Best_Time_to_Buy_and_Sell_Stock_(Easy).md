### Question:
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
> 
> **Output:** 5
>
> **Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
> 
> Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** prices = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
> 
> **Output:** 0
>
> **Explanation:** In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

### Wrong answer:
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        # First method of O(n^2) by Brute Force, 198/212
        profit = 0
        for i in range(len(prices)-1):
            for j in range(i+1, len(prices)):
                if prices[j]-prices[i] > profit:
                    profit = prices[j]-prices[i]
        return profit
```

<br>

### My Solution:
Just use two variables `cheapest` to keep track of the cheapest index, and `profit` to keep track of the maximum profit so far.
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        # Second method of O(n) by sliding windows technique
        cheapest = prices[0]
        profit = 0
        for i in prices:
            if i < cheapest:
                cheapest = i
            elif i - cheapest > 0 and i - cheapest > profit:
                profit = i-cheapest
        return profit
```
Time Complexity: $O(n)$ <br>
Space Complexity: $O(1)$
