<br>

### Question:
There are `n` buildings in a line. You are given an integer array `heights` of size `n` that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.

The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a **smaller** height.

Return a list of indices **(0-indexed)** of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.

<br>

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** heights = [4,2,3,1]
> 
> **Output:** [0,2,3]
>
> **Explanation:** Building 1 (0-indexed) does not have an ocean view because building 2 is taller.

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** heights = [4,3,2,1]
> 
> **Output:** [0,1,2,3]
>
> **Explanation:** All the buildings have an ocean view.

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** heights = [1,3,2,4]
> 
> **Output:** [3]
>
> **Explanation:** Only building 3 has an ocean view.

<br>

#### Constraints:
* `1 <= heights.length <= 10^5`

* `1 <= heights[i] <= 10^9`

<br>

### Walk-through: 
1. Traverse `heights` from right to left, as the last height as `curMax` and append its index into `res[]`.

2. Each time, if `heights[i] > curMax` we update `curMax = heights[i]` and add this index `i` into `res[]`.

3. Finally, return the reversed `res[::-1]`.

<br>

### Python Solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def findBuildings(self, heights: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # Traverse from right to left, save the last height as `curMax`, each time, we compare heights[i] with curMax, if elem > curMax: update curMax and save the index into res[].

        # TC: O(n), n = len(heights), SC: O(n)
        curMax = heights[-1]
        res = [len(heights)-1]
        for i in range(len(heights)-2, -1, -1):
            if heights[i] > curMax:
                curMax = heights[i]
                res.append(i)
        return res[::-1]
```
**Time Complexity:** $O(n)$ <br>
**Space Complexity:** $O(n)$
